{"strategyName":"Paper Press","strategyId":"/strategies/paper-press?pokemon=kartana&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Knock Off is the one move Choice Band Kartana uses the most because of its unparalleled utility in gradually weakening its most common checks, including <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>. Removing their items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots, helps Kartana and its teammates break through these foes. Sacred Sword, in addition to targeting Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>, can bypass Iron Defense boosts from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, letting Kartana break through them if positioned well.</p>\n<p>Choice Band Kartana fits well with <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> on Future Sight-based balance or bulky offense teams because of its incredible synergy with Future Sight, which lets it easily bust through typical checks like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and even Skarmory. Slowking's Teleport also gives it safe switches for more wallbreaking opportunities. Kartana's ability to wallbreak and remove Steel- and Flying-type answers makes partners like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> and Tornadus-T thrive. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a> can remove Corviknight, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn, making Choice Band Kartana less prediction-reliant and helping it wallbreak more easily. Because Kartana systematically removes items from an opponent's whole team, especially Heavy-Duty Boots, Stealth Rock setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and Heatran are solid teammates, as they set up their entry hazards while pressuring Kartana's checks with Toxic and Magma Storm, respectively.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Kartana","pokemonId":"/pokemon/kartana","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":59},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":181},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":131},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":59},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":31},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":109}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Beast Boost","abilityId":"/abilities/beast-boost","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's highest stat is raised by 1 if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:40.6572526Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Band","itemId":"/items/choice-band","itemDetails":"Holder's Attack is 1.5x, but it can only select the first move it executes."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Beast Boost","abilityId":"/abilities/beast-boost","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's highest stat is raised by 1 if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Leaf Blade","moveId":"/moves/leaf-blade","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"High critical hit ratio."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Smart Strike","moveId":"/moves/smart-strike","moveType":{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":70,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"This move does not check accuracy."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Knock Off","moveId":"/moves/knock-off","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":65,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"1.5x damage if foe holds an item.
