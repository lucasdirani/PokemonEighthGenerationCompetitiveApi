{"strategyName":"Special Wall","strategyId":"/strategies/special-wall?pokemon=hippowdon&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Hippowdon functions as a sturdy check to special attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a> and provides helpful utility with Toxic and Stealth Rock to support its teammates. Toxic allows Hippowdon to punish non-Poison-immune Flying-types that attempt to remove its entry hazards, such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>, and other vulnerable walls such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>. Whirlwind is also a viable option, allowing Hippowdon to phaze foes it cannot do much against, such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>. Whirlwind can also be used to prevent Hippowdon from being used as setup fodder by setup sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> and Volcarona. Leftovers provides Hippowdon with passive recovery and helps alleviate pressure from offensive threats by letting it waste less turns healing with Slack Off. 8 Attack EVs ensure Hippowdon OHKOes <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> with Earthquake. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents residual damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes, although the passive recovery from Leftovers is in most cases too good to pass up.</p>\n<p>Hippowdon's Electric immunity and access to reliable recovery give it defensive synergy with partners on more defensive teams and pivots such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> and Clefable; it helps the team from being overwhelmed by Electric-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a> and Tapu Koko. Pressure users such as Corviknight and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a> are great partners alongside Hippowdon, as they can wear down the PP of Defog and make it much easier for Hippowdon’s Stealth Rock to stay up long-term - they can also provide entry hazard removal so that Hippowdon doesn’t get worn down by entry hazards. Sand Rush Excadrill can utilize Hippowdon's sand to clean late-game after a Swords Dance while also providing entry hazard removal. Knock Off and status absorbers like Clefable and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/reuniclus\" hreflang=\"en\">Reuniclus</a> are useful if Hippowdon is being utilized on defensive teams, as they provide the team with much more longevity in the long term. Bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-fini\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Fini</a> are greatly appreciated; Toxapex can handle <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a> and Toxic <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a>, while Tapu Fini can prevent status from crippling Hippowdon, although this also prevents Hippowdon from using Toxic against grounded Pokemon.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Hippowdon","pokemonId":"/pokemon/hippowdon","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":108},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":112},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":118},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":68},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":72},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":47}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sand Stream","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-stream","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Sandstorm."},{"abilityName":"Sand Force","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-force","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Ground/Rock/Steel attacks do 1.3x in Sandstorm; immunity to it."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:39.964303Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."},{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sand Stream","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-stream","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Sandstorm."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Careful","natureId":"/natures/careful","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":8},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":248},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Earthquake","moveId":"/moves/earthquake","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Hits adjacent Pokemon.
