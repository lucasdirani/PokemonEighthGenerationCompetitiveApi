{"strategyName":"Offensive Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/offensive-pivot?pokemon=zarude&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Zarude's STAB combination allows it to threaten many tier staples like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>. U-turn grabs momentum on usual switch-ins such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>. Jungle Healing allows Zarude to remove status conditions from moves such as Toxic from Aegislash and Will-O-Wisp from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>, while restoring 25% of its health.  Heavy-Duty Boots allows Zarude to not worry about entry hazards, letting it constantly pivot throughout the game. Jolly is the required nature on the set so that Zarude can outspeed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>.</p>\n<p>Heavy-Duty Boots Zarude is seen on balance and bulky offense due to the easy pivoting provided by Heavy-Duty Boots and its ability to act as a status sponge against Toxic from Aegislash and Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W. Secondary pivots like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a>, Thundurus-T, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a> all form potent pivoting cores with Zarude. Mienshao can revenge kill faster threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> if holding a Choice Scarf, while Thundurus-T heavily pressures Celesteela and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>. Swampert can pivot into attacks from Celesteela and set entry hazards for Zarude to soften up Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> with Stealth Rock. Other entry hazard setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diancie\" hreflang=\"en\">Diancie</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, and Excadrill also can do this and appreciate Zarude dealing with Water-types such as Rotom-W, while Zarude appreciates them dealing with Salamence, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chandelure\" hreflang=\"en\">Chandelure</a> are wallbreakers that appreciate Zarude bringing them in on Salamence, Tangrowth, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, as they often have trouble switching in safely due to their low Speed and frailty.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Zarude","pokemonId":"/pokemon/zarude","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":120},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":105}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Leaf Guard","abilityId":"/abilities/leaf-guard","abilityDetails":"If Sunny Day is active, this Pokemon cannot be statused and Rest will fail for it."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"RU","tierId":"/tiers/ru"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:23:29.7859542Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Leaf Guard","abilityId":"/abilities/leaf-guard","abilityDetails":"If Sunny Day is active, this Pokemon cannot be statused and Rest will fail for it."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Power Whip","moveId":"/moves/power-whip","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":120,"moveAccuracy":85,"moveDetails":"No additional effect."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Darkest Lariat","moveId":"/moves/darkest-lariat","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":85,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Ignores the target's stat stage changes."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"U-turn","moveId":"/moves/u-turn","moveType":{"typeName":"Bug","typeId":"/types/bug"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":70,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User switches out after damaging the target."}],"strategyFourthMoves":[{"moveName":"Jungle Healing","moveId":"/moves/jungle-healing","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"User and allies: healed 1/4 max HP, status cured."}]}}
