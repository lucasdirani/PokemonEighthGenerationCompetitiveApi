{"strategyName":"RestTalk","strategyId":"/strategies/resttalk?pokemon=moltres-galar&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>RestTalk Galarian Moltres can provide a lot of utility to a team by checking and breaking through foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a>. Fiery Wrath is the main attack on this set, as it has acceptable coverage and is reliable. Hurricane is preferable on Galarian Moltres, as it prevents it giving free switches to a range of potent offensive threats such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a>. Nasty Plot is an option over Hurricane, as it provides the necessary power to overwhelm Pokemon like Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro. Rest and Sleep Talk allow Galarian Moltres to effectively check foes like Aegislash, absorb status, and lets it accumulate Berserk boosts. The Speed EVs let Galarian Moltres outspeed Aegislash, while the rest of the EVs with a Calm nature go towards special bulk to help Galarian Moltres against special attackers such as Aegislash and special <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Galarian Moltres from taking Stealth Rock damage, easing the need for it to use Rest often.</p>\n<p>This set can be challenging to fit onto teams because it has a very unique role and is vulnerable to powerful wallbreakers such as Primarina and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>. It fares best on bulky offense and balance builds, however. Azumarill is a helpful partner to this set, as it is able to break through just about any special wall that can threaten Galarian Moltres, particularly <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diancie\" hreflang=\"en\">Diancie</a>. Galarian Moltres can help Azumarill by providing an ideal matchup against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>. Assault Vest Tangrowth can help check Electric-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> that can take advantage of Galarian Moltres, especially after using Rest. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> is a great partner that can help check foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> and Conkeldurr as well as act as a better Knock Off absorber against the likes of <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>. In return, Galarian Moltres can check Pokemon like Amoonguss and Aegislash that limit Skarmory. Diancie can provide Heal Bell support to wake Galarian Moltres up after it has used Rest. Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> and Aegislash are extremely important partners, checking one of Galarian Moltres's biggest checks in <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>. Jirachi can also provide Wish support so that Galarian Moltres doesn't have to use Rest as often, while Aegislash can threaten <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Moltres-Galar","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/moltres-galar","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":90}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Berserk","abilityId":"/abilities/berserk","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Sp.
