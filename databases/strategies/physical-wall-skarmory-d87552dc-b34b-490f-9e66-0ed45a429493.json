{"strategyName":"Physical Wall","strategyId":"/strategies/physical-wall?pokemon=skarmory&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Body Press utilizes Skarmory's amazing Defense to hit many opposing Pokemon hard, devastating the likes of <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a>. It also keeps <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a> from coming in freely. Alternatively, Brave Bird lets Skarmory hit <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/roserade\" hreflang=\"en\">Roserade</a> super effectively and deal solid damage to <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>. Spikes wears down common defensive Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>. Skarmory has plenty of opportunities to set Spikes up against Pokemon that typically cannot threaten it, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>. Whirlwind synergizes well with Spikes, forcing chip damage on switch-ins like Aegislash. It also prevents setup sweepers like Gyarados and Belly Drum Azumarill from setting up. Alternatively, Toxic cripples setup sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>, which typically have free entry on it, and hinders Defoggers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> from removing Spikes in the long run. Skarmory can run Defog on stall teams thanks to its ability to handle entry hazard setters like Roserade, Excadrill, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>. Rocky Helmet allows Skarmory to punish pivoting attempts from Swampert, Jirachi, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>, prevent Excadrill from freely using Rapid Spin, and wear down threats like Azumarill, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>, and Gyarados quickly. The given Speed EVs allow Skarmory to outspeed Azumarill and Conkeldurr.</p>\n<p>Skarmory best fits on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams that appreciate its Spikes support and walling capabilities. Chansey makes an excellent partner for Skarmory, taking on dangerous special attackers like Hydreigon, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>, and Thundurus-T, while Skarmory handles physical attackers like Excadrill and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diggersby\" hreflang=\"en\">Diggersby</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> similarly checks Moltres and special Salamence, and it also acts as a secondary check to Conkeldurr and Mamoswine with Colbur Berry. Additionally, its Future Sight alongside Skarmory's Whirlwind can hinder offensive Pokemon like Thundurus-T. Stealth Rock setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diancie\" hreflang=\"en\">Diancie</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>, and Excadrill form great entry-hazard stacking cores with Skarmory. Diancie beats Hydreigon, Moltres, and Thundurus-T; Nihilego also beats the aforementioned threats and can hinder Aegislash with Knock Off; and Excadrill can pressure Aegislash and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> and remove opposing entry hazards without compromising Skarmory's own Spikes. Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth make good secondary checks to Tapu Bulu and Conkeldurr so Skarmory doesn't get overwhelmed checking them. They also can absorb Knock Off for the team, allowing Skarmory to preserve Rocky Helmet and chip down Jirachi. Zarude and the aformentioned Grass-types can help take on strong Electric- and Water-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> as well. Powerful wallbreakers like Aegislash, Thundurus-T, and Choice Specs Primarina all appreciate Skarmory's Spikes wearing down checks like Tangrowth and Chansey. On stall teams, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/quagsire\" hreflang=\"en\">Quagsire</a> can provide an Electric immunity to block Volt Switch and check Thundurus-T. It also can handle setup sweepers that can bypass Skarmory like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Aegislash. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> acts as a primary check to Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados, secondary check to Mamoswine, and way to beat <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chandelure\" hreflang=\"en\">Chandelure</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weezing-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Weezing</a> counters Conkeldurr and can provide Defog support to prevent Skarmory from being worn down into range of Mamoswine's Icicle Crash.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Skarmory","pokemonId":"/pokemon/skarmory","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":140},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":40},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":70}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sturdy","abilityId":"/abilities/sturdy","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon is at full HP, it survives one hit with at least 1 HP.
