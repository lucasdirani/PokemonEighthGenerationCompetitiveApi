{"strategyName":"Swords Dance","strategyId":"/strategies/swords-dance?pokemon=garchomp&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Garchomp can act as a very powerful sweeper or wallbreaker because of its nearly unresisted STAB move combination and tools to pressure checks. It primarily uses Fire Fang to check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>. Scale Shot's Speed boost makes Garchomp outspeed slower revenge killers and sweep effectively. Stone Edge can be used over Fire Fang to threaten Flying-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>. Threatening these bulky Defoggers makes Garchomp an excellent Stealth Rock setter. Leftovers provides more longevity, while Life Orb applies more pressure against physical walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> and Ferrothorn.</p>\n<p>Scale Shot Garchomp often features on offense teams utilizing other wallbreakers alongside dual screens support to make it sweep as effectively as possible. Scale Shot sets often need their health to be able to set up and sweep. If Garchomp runs Stealth Rock or Stone Edge, many Pokemon can benefit from its ability to pressure most Flying-types, most notably <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a>, which can break through teams incredibly easily. Additionally, Corviknight can serve as a good defensive partner. Garchomp can offensively answer Corviknight's checks, such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and Zapdos, while Corviknight can check some common revenge killers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>. Swords Dance Garchomp does not have many solid defensive answers besides Steel / Flying types such as Skarmory and Corviknight and Unaware Pokemon like Clefable. Heatran, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> can exert pressure on these checks to give Garchomp easier setup opportunities.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Garchomp","pokemonId":"/pokemon/garchomp","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":108},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":102}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Rough Skin","abilityId":"/abilities/rough-skin","abilityDetails":"Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon lose 1/8 of their max HP."},{"abilityName":"Sand Veil","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-veil","abilityDetails":"If Sandstorm is active, this Pokemon's evasiveness is 1.25x; immunity to Sandstorm."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:38.9426074Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Rough Skin","abilityId":"/abilities/rough-skin","abilityDetails":"Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon lose 1/8 of their max HP."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Swords Dance","moveId":"/moves/swords-dance","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Attack by 2."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Earthquake","moveId":"/moves/earthquake","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Hits adjacent Pokemon.
