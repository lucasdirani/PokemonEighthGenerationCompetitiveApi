{"strategyName":"Double Dance","strategyId":"/strategies/double-dance?pokemon=moltres-galar&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>After using both Nasty Plot and Agility, Galarian Moltres can OHKO most the metagame and outspeeds the entirety of it, even outspeeding weather abusers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/venusaur\" hreflang=\"en\">Venusaur</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kingdra\" hreflang=\"en\">Kingdra</a> in their respective weathers. The only attacks needed here are STAB attacks Fiery Wrath and Hurricane, as the only UU-relevant Pokemon they miss out on is <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diancie\" hreflang=\"en\">Diancie</a>. Fiery Wrath's flinch chance also can give Galarian Moltres chances to break through bulkier Pokemon that can tank its attacks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>. Air Slash is an option over Hurricane if accuracy concerns arise. Weakness Policy is the optimal item for this set, as the most effective way to take down Galarian Moltres is a super effective attack, meaning it activates a decent amount of the time and gives Galarian Moltres exceptional power when coupled with Nasty Plot. Using Weakness Policy can also create opportunities for Galarian Moltres to set up in one turn by using Agility as a super effective attack hits it. Sitrus Berry can allow Galarian Moltres to regain its health and activate Berserk for a second time. Heavy-Duty Boots is also a viable item choice, as preventing Stealth Rock damage can make it much more challenging for an opponent to take down Galarian Moltres.</p>\n<p>Double Dance Galarian Moltres fits primarily on hyper offense teams, though it also works on some balance teams as a late-game win condition. Stealth Rock setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> can help rack up chip damage on Pokemon that check Galarian Moltres such as Diancie. It also provides an Electric-type immunity and Rapid Spin, keeping Galarian Moltres from getting chipped by Stealth Rock. Physical sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>, Belly Drum <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>, and Swords Dance <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> fit well on hyper offense teams and can break through or soften up specially bulky Pokemon able to halt a Galarian Moltres sweep such as Chansey and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>. Galarian Moltres can beat Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> that trouble these Pokemon in return. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/grimmsnarl\" hreflang=\"en\">Grimmsnarl</a> can provide dual screens support to give Galarian Moltres an easier time setting up as it becomes exceptionally difficult to take down behind screens. Pivots like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a> can bring Galarian Moltres in to safely set up against physical walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>. It can also beat Chansey for it.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Moltres-Galar","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/moltres-galar","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":90}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Berserk","abilityId":"/abilities/berserk","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Sp.
