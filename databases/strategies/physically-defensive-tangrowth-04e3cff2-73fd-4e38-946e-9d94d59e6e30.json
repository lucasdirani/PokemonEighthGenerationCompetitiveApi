{"strategyName":"Physically Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/physically-defensive?pokemon=tangrowth&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Knock Off provides great utility for Tangrowth, removing items from common switch-ins such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>. Focus Blast mainly serves to hit Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/bisharp\" hreflang=\"en\">Bisharp</a> to force them out. Sleep Powder helps with Tangrowth‘s passivity issue by preventing free opposing setup, incapacitating threats, and letting a teammate switch in freely. Stun Spore is an alternative to Sleep Powder that can incapacitate threats permanently, unlike Sleep Powder. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to chip down physical attackers and Pokemon trying to pivot with U-turn such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, Kartana, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>.</p>\n<p>Tangrowth fits best on defensive teams that appreciate a bulky Grass-type that can check Ground-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>. They also benefit from having a reliable and consistent check to physical attackers, particularly wallbreakers like Bisharp and Urshifu-R, that can force progress with Knock Off and generate opportunities for its teammates. Ground-types work well with Tangrowth, as they appreciate it taking on Water- and Grass-types like Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, and Kartana. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a>, Garchomp, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gastrodon\" hreflang=\"en\">Gastrodon</a> work well to check most threatening special attackers like Heatran. Tangrowth's meager Special Defense requires having partners that can take on special attackers: specially defensive Heatran and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a> are excellent teammates that can take care of Zapdos, Life Orb <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>. In return, they appreciate Tangrowth taking care of physical attackers, such as Landorus-T, Zeraora, and Urshifu-R. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> can form a Regenerator core with Tangrowth to handle threats like Heatran and Tapu Lele. Having entry hazard removal is very useful, as entry hazard damage can put Tangrowth in range of some of the tier's stronger wallbreakers, such as Swords Dance Kartana. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> is a great partner on bulkier builds, as it can alleviate pressure for Tangrowth by checking Rillaboom and Kartana, while Zapdos can check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, which is really good at exploiting Tangrowth‘s low Special Defense. Additional checks to physical attackers that Tangrowth can't handle are also beneficial; <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> can take care of <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a>, while Corviknight alongside a revenge killer such as Weavile can stop Swords Dance variants of Garchomp or Landorus-T. Corviknight can also alleviate pressure by helping Tangrowth against Rillaboom + <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a> cores as well as Grass-type spam cores.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Tangrowth","pokemonId":"/pokemon/tangrowth","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":50}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Chlorophyll","abilityId":"/abilities/chlorophyll","abilityDetails":"If Sunny Day is active, this Pokemon's Speed is doubled."},{"abilityName":"Leaf Guard","abilityId":"/abilities/leaf-guard","abilityDetails":"If Sunny Day is active, this Pokemon cannot be statused and Rest will fail for it."},{"abilityName":"Regenerator","abilityId":"/abilities/regenerator","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon restores 1/3 of its maximum HP, rounded down, when it switches out."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:34.4296667Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Rocky Helmet","itemId":"/items/rocky-helmet","itemDetails":"If holder is hit by a contact move, the attacker loses 1/6 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Regenerator","abilityId":"/abilities/regenerator","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon restores 1/3 of its maximum HP, rounded down, when it switches out."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Relaxed","natureId":"/natures/relaxed","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Giga Drain","moveId":"/moves/giga-drain","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":75,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User recovers 50% of the damage dealt."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Knock Off","moveId":"/moves/knock-off","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":65,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"1.5x damage if foe holds an item.
