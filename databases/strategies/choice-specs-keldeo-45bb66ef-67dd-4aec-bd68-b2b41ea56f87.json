{"strategyName":"Choice Specs","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-specs?pokemon=keldeo&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump can 2HKO even Water-resistant targets such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>. Secret Sword lets Keldeo break through <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> and Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> while hitting offensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> hard. Scald is a safer move to throw out against foes that can punish a Hydro Pump miss like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a> while circumventing Hydro Pump's low PP. It can also cripple foes such as Tangrowth and Azumarill. Surf is an option on rain teams to 2HKO foes like Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/reuniclus\" hreflang=\"en\">Reuniclus</a> after Stealth Rock. Icy Wind OHKOes Salamence and provides coverage for Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/roserade\" hreflang=\"en\">Roserade</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>. Air Slash is an alternative option that hits Amoonguss and Tangrowth much harder, but Keldeo can already 2HKO Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth with Icy Wind and Secret Sword after Stealth Rock, so it's less appealing.</p>\n<p>Keldeo fits best on offense teams that value the sheer power it provides alongside a great Speed tier. Although Keldeo has a great defensive typing, it prefers to be brought in safely by pivots such as Chansey and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>. Keldeo is a fantastic rain attacker, as the extra power provided prevents Amoonguss from being a reliable switch-in. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/pelipper\" hreflang=\"en\">Pelipper</a> can set rain with Drizzle, bring Keldeo in safely with U-turn, and pressure Grass-types with Hurricane. Other rain sweepers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/barraskewda\" hreflang=\"en\">Barraskewda</a> can work alongside Keldeo for both to wear down each other's checks such as Tangrowth. Entry hazard setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a> help Keldeo pick up important KOs such as 2HKOing Tangrowth with Secret Sword after Stealth Rock. Nihilego can also help check special Salamence, while Krookodile can force a lot of damage against foes like Amoonguss and take on Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a> and Reuniclus. Late-game cleaners such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> and Dragon Dance Salamence appreciate Keldeo's ability to wear down or remove foes like Amoonguss and Primarina. In return, Lycanroc-D can help revenge kill threats such as Dragon Dance <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a> and Salamence, which Keldeo may give a free setup opportunity to if locked into the wrong move, and remove faster foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/starmie\" hreflang=\"en\">Starmie</a> with Accelerock.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Keldeo","pokemonId":"/pokemon/keldeo","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Fighting","typeId":"/types/fighting"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":91},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":72},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":129},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":108}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Justified","abilityId":"/abilities/justified","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Attack is raised by 1 stage after it is damaged by a Dark-type move."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:27.7230884Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Specs","itemId":"/items/choice-specs","itemDetails":"Holder's Sp.
