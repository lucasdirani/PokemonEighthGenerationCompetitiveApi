{"strategyName":"Utility","strategyId":"/strategies/utility?pokemon=zapdos&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Discharge spreads paralysis, making it hard for common specially defensive switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a> to switch in safely. Volt Switch can be used over Discharge, as it lets Zapdos pivot out against the aforementioned checks and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>. It should be used alongside Hurricane to punish Ground-types harder as they attempt to block Volt Switch. Heat Wave can be used over Hurricane, targeting Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a> at the cost of much less damage against Ground-types. Defog adds to Zapdos's utility by letting it remove entry hazards, although it's often forced to do so on free turns like forced switches, as it loses to a lot of common Stealth Rock users like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a>, and Clefable that are able to cripple Zapdos with either Knock Off or Toxic. Some Stealth Rock users like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>, Landorus-T, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a> can also carry Rock-type coverage to pressure Zapdos. Static can punish U-turn users like Landorus-T, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>. 40 Speed EVs let Zapdos outspeed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and the rest are invested into HP and Defense to maximize Zapdos's physical bulk.</p>\n<p>Scizor makes a great defensive partner, as it can take pressure off of Zapdos to check Rillaboom and check Ice-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a>. Zapdos can also pivot on some of its checks, like Galarian Slowking and Blissey, to bring Scizor in and threaten them with Knock Off or continue the VoltTurn cycle. Landorus-T also makes a good partner, as it can help out Zapdos by checking opposing Landorus-T, Swords Dance Garchomp, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, while Zapdos is able to switch into offensive Grass-types that trouble Landorus-T, like Rillaboom and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>. Dragapult can make use of Zapdos's ability to force out some of its checks, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>, while Zapdos benefits from Dragapult's ability to force out Kyurem and offensive Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T. Rillaboom pressures Ground-types like Hippowdon and Garchomp, which can wall Zapdos. Rillaboom also benefits from Zapdos's ability to force out common Flying-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> and Corviknight and do huge damage to Ferrothorn, letting Rillaboom spam its Grass-type STAB moves much more freely. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a> also makes a great partner, as Zapdos can use Volt Switch to bring it in safely against Pokemon like Clefable and Galarian Slowking. Melmetal also benefits from Zapdos's ability to switch into Fighting-types and Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage, like Urshifu-R and Kartana.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Zapdos","pokemonId":"/pokemon/zapdos","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":100}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Pressure","abilityId":"/abilities/pressure","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon is the target of a foe's move, that move loses one additional PP."},{"abilityName":"Static","abilityId":"/abilities/static","abilityDetails":"30% chance a Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon will be paralyzed."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:50.1769422Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Static","abilityId":"/abilities/static","abilityDetails":"30% chance a Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon will be paralyzed."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":248},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":220},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":40}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Discharge","moveId":"/moves/discharge","moveType":{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"30% chance to paralyze adjacent Pokemon."},{"moveName":"Volt Switch","moveId":"/moves/volt-switch","moveType":{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":70,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User switches out after damaging the target."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Hurricane","moveId":"/moves/hurricane","moveType":{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":110,"moveAccuracy":70,"moveDetails":"30% chance to confuse target.
