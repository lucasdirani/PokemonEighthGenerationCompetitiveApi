{"strategyName":"Utility","strategyId":"/strategies/utility?pokemon=ferrothorn&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Ferrothorn is the best Spikes setter in the tier thanks to its ability to threaten common forms of entry hazard control like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> with Knock Off. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used over Spikes if your team lacks a Stealth Rock setter; however, Ferrothorn will have a harder time breaking through defensive cores. Leech Seed is Ferrothorn's main source of recovery and is particularly helpful because it makes Ferrothorn, which is usually a passive Pokemon, much harder to switch into. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Ferrothorn to check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a>, and other physical attackers well.</p>\n<p>Ferrothorn fits on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate the defensive utility it provides as a Spikes setter. Wallbreakers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> appreciate the entry hazards Ferrothorn sets up and can pressure revenge killers such as Zeraora and Weavile. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> both have great defensive synergy with Ferrothorn, as they can wear down common checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>. They, alongside other Stealth Rock setters such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, can also help Ferrothorn by allowing it to run Spikes. It's incredibly important to provide checks to Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a>, as Ferrothorn is extremely vulnerable to them. Therefore, Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-fini\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Fini</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> are fantastic partners for it. Fast pivots such as Tornadus-T and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> provide VoltTurn support and retain momentum against Pokemon like Corviknight and Mandibuzz, which only fear Knock Off from Ferrothorn, while benefiting from it setting up Spikes to further pressure their defensive switch-ins like Heatran and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>. They can also give Ferrothorn opportunities to set up entry hazards and utilize Knock Off more reliably after pivoting against its checks such as Corviknight and Zapdos. Rain teams also deserve a special mention, as they have formidable synergy with Ferrothorn; Ferrothorn provides Spikes support to wear down the opposing team for rain wallbreakers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kingdra\" hreflang=\"en\">Kingdra</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/seismitoad\" hreflang=\"en\">Seismitoad</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/barraskewda\" hreflang=\"en\">Barraskewda</a>, it acts as a great check to many Pokemon that threaten rain teams such as Tapu Koko and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, while rain reduces its weakness to Fire.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Ferrothorn","pokemonId":"/pokemon/ferrothorn","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":74},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":94},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":131},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":54},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":116},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":20}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Anticipation","abilityId":"/abilities/anticipation","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon shudders if any foe has a supereffective or OHKO move."},{"abilityName":"Iron Barbs","abilityId":"/abilities/iron-barbs","abilityDetails":"Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon lose 1/8 of their max HP."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:38.5793226Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Iron Barbs","abilityId":"/abilities/iron-barbs","abilityDetails":"Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon lose 1/8 of their max HP."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Impish","natureId":"/natures/impish","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Spikes","moveId":"/moves/spikes","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Hurts grounded foes on switch-in.
