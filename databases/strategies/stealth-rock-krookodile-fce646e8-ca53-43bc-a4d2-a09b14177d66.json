{"strategyName":"Stealth Rock","strategyId":"/strategies/stealth-rock?pokemon=krookodile&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Krookodile's role compression and item versatility let it perform on both hyper offense teams and on more defensive ones, like balance and bulky offense. With Life Orb, this set fits on hyper offense teams as a great lead. If running Leftovers or a Berry, this set fits on bulky offense and balance teams, which appreciate Krookodile's utility and resistances. Knock Off is useful for checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, crippling them for Krookodile's teammates. High Horsepower should be used in place of Earthquake if <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a> is on Krookodile's team, as Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquake. Stealth Rock wears down Pokemon like Celesteela and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> for teammates like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>. Toxic allows Krookodile to cripple checks such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. Taunt prevents Stealth Rock and Defog from Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, Swampert, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>. Leftovers offsets entry hazard damage and gives Krookodile longevity to keep threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>, Excadrill, and Aegislash in check more easily. Chople Berry lets Krookodile take <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a>'s Close Combat and KO back with Earthquake. It also helps Krookodile take <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>'s Focus Blast to then weaken or KO it. Maximum investement in HP lets Krookodile better check Excadrill and Aegislash.</p>\n<p>Setup sweepers such as Thundurus-T and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> work well with Krookodile, as it can set Stealth Rock up and weaken their checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diancie\" hreflang=\"en\">Diancie</a> and Primarina. Special attackers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a> and Nihilego appreciate Krookodile denting and crippling their checks in <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> and Celesteela with Knock Off, paving their way to sweep. In return, they compensate for Krookodile's lower Speed tier and remove Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>, and Tapu Bulu. Amoonguss can check Pokemonn like Primarina, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a>, and Zarude for Krookodile, and together they can keep Lycanroc-D in check. Salamence forms a double Intimidate core with Krookodile, weakening Pokemon like Zarude and stopping setup sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a> from getting out of control. Krookodile is vulnerable against Fairy-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/togekiss\" hreflang=\"en\">Togekiss</a> so partners like Aegislash, Rotom-W, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a> are valuable. Tapu Bulu threatens Azumarill and Primarina for Krookodile. It can also provide Grassy Terrain to give Krookodile more recovery.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Krookodile","pokemonId":"/pokemon/krookodile","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":117},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":92}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."},{"abilityName":"Anger Point","abilityId":"/abilities/anger-point","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon (not its substitute) takes a critical hit, its Attack is raised 12 stages."},{"abilityName":"Moxie","abilityId":"/abilities/moxie","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Attack is raised by 1 stage if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:28.8111164Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."},{"itemName":"Chople Berry","itemId":"/items/chople-berry","itemDetails":"Halves damage taken from a supereffective Fighting-type attack.
