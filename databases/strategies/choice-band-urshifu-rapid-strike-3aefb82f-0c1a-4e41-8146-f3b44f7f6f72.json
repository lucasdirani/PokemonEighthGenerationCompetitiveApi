{"strategyName":"Choice Band","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-band?pokemon=urshifu-rapid-strike&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Surging Strikes ignores Defense boosts from Pokemon such as Iron Defense <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, as well as breaking through Substitutes and potential Focus Sashes. Aqua Jet is great for revenge killing chipped foes, especially helping in the hyper offense matchup. Frailer Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blacephalon\" hreflang=\"en\">Blacephalon</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hawlucha\" hreflang=\"en\">Hawlucha</a> all take good damage from Aqua Jet, with the former two being OHKOed and Hawlucha having a potential sweep stopped when chipped. U-turn lets Urshifu-R keep up momentum on defensive switch-ins and provide wallbreaking opportunities for its teammates. Choice Band allows it to 2HKO many pivots such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, Skarmory, and Corviknight. A Jolly nature allows Urshifu-R to outspeed and revenge kill Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>. Ice Punch can be used over Aqua Jet, giving it a very hard hit on Dragon-types trying to pivot into and scout it such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragonite\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragonite</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>. It also gives a decently strong hit against Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> without having the Defense drop and Pokemon immune to it.</p>\n<p>With Urshifu-R acting as a very strong pivot with U-turn, many powerful wallbreakers appreciate its presence. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, and Kyurem can be given free switch ins and threaten out checks to Urshifu-R such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, Tangrowth, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> with their own powerful attacks. Heatran in particular appreciates free switch in from U-turn to fire off Magma Storm and trap foes, and, as Dragon- and Water-types commonly come into Heatran, this chips them down for Urshifu-R to break. Dragapult can invite Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> that Urshifu-R can pressure, and together they can remove shared checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-fini\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Fini</a>, forming a terrifying wallbreaking core. Tapu Lele works as a great partner to help overwhelm common pivots like Slowking while also appreciating momentum from Urshifu-R's U-turn. With Rocky Helmet users being such a big issue for Urshifu-R, Knock Off users such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, Kartana, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, which invite in Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Toxapex, are greatly appreciated. Rain support provided by <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/pelipper\" hreflang=\"en\">Pelipper</a> powers up Surging Strikes to incredible levels and lets Aqua Jet revenge kill foes more easily. Defensive checks such as Tapu Fini, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a>, and specially defensive Toxapex are much less safe switch-ins with rain up. Future Sight support from the likes of Slowking, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>, and Slowbro is also incredibly useful for Urshifu-R, helping it break through checks it normally can't such as Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Blissey acts as a specially bulky pivot that covers for some of Urshifu-R's big weaknesses to Pokemon like Dragapult while also giving it free switch ins with Teleport to wallbreak.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Urshifu-Rapid-Strike","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/urshifu-rapid-strike","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Fighting","typeId":"/types/fighting"},{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":63},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":97}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Unseen Fist","abilityId":"/abilities/unseen-fist","abilityDetails":"All contact moves hit through protection."}],"pokemonFormTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:49.4936492Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Band","itemId":"/items/choice-band","itemDetails":"Holder's Attack is 1.5x, but it can only select the first move it executes."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Unseen Fist","abilityId":"/abilities/unseen-fist","abilityDetails":"All contact moves hit through protection."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Surging Strikes","moveId":"/moves/surging-strikes","moveType":{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":25,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Always results in a critical hit.
