{"strategyName":"Choice Specs","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-specs?pokemon=aegislash&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Choice Specs makes Aegislash one of the strongest and most terrifying wallbreakers in the entire tier, allowing it to break through and 2HKO walls like Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> with Stealth Rock. Shadow Ball is a very spammable move. Flash Cannon damages a great majority of Ghost-resistant foes and other specific targets like Bulletproof <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a>. Close Combat makes Aegislash not completely walled by <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>. The EV spread and Rash nature give it a chance to 2HKO Chansey with Stealth Rock, but Aegislash must be careful because of the move's low PP and Soft-Boiled outhealing it. Shadow Sneak picks off weakened sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/polteageist\" hreflang=\"en\">Polteageist</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a>.</p>\n<p>This set can be used on bulky offense teams and should be used early-game to wallbreak. However, due to Aegislash's mediocre Speed tier, it's very susceptible to being KOed so it appreciates pivots as teammates. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a> are great to safely bring Aegislash in, and they are also good at pressuring Assault Vest Tangrowth. This set can't reliably break past some specially defensive walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/milotic\" hreflang=\"en\">Milotic</a>, making strong physical wallbreakers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> good teammates; in return, these Pokemon appreciate Aegislash threatening answers to them like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a> and physically defensive Tangrowth. Late-game cleaners like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> and Choice Scarf <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a> greatly appreciate Aegislash weakening defensive Pokemon like Kommo-o and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> for them. Stealth Rock support from partners like Kommo-o and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> is very valuable, as it allows Choice Specs Aegislash's Shadow Ball to 2HKO Assault Vest Tangrowth and RestTalk <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Aegislash","pokemonId":"/pokemon/aegislash","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},{"typeName":"Ghost","typeId":"/types/ghost"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":140},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":140},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":60}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Stance Change","abilityId":"/abilities/stance-change","abilityDetails":"If Aegislash, changes Forme to Blade before attacks and Shield before King's Shield."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:22.3419492Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Specs","itemId":"/items/choice-specs","itemDetails":"Holder's Sp.
