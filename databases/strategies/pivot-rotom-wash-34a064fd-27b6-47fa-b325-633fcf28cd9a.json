{"strategyName":"Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/pivot?pokemon=rotom-wash&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Volt Switch is required so Rotom-W can gain momentum against Grass- and Dragon-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a> while bringing in teammates like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chandelure\" hreflang=\"en\">Chandelure</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> to threaten them. Hydro Pump destroys common entry hazard setters such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>. Pain Split is Rotom-W's only recovery move and gives Rotom-W more utility against bulkier teams, though it can be easy to play around. Will-O-Wisp cripples <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, Dragon Dance <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>, and Tangrowth. Other status moves can be used over Will-O-Wisp; Toxic limits <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/seismitoad\" hreflang=\"en\">Seismitoad</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gastrodon\" hreflang=\"en\">Gastrodon</a>'s longevity better, whereas Thunder Wave cripples <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/noivern\" hreflang=\"en\">Noivern</a> and Kommo-o. Defog is an alternative option because Rotom-W has several opportunities to remove hazards, such as when facing <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>, while having a good matchup against many of the entry hazard setters. Leftovers is Rotom-W's primary way of standing up to repeated U-turn and Stealth Rock damage. Maximum Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed and OHKO <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> as well as potentially cripple offensive Kommo-o with Will-O-Wisp.</p>\n<p>Rotom-W fits on bulky offense and balance teams, which appreciate its ability to check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>. U-turn users such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> and Moltres form VoltTurn cores with Rotom-W that can be difficult to stop, as Rotom-W threatens their checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> and Rhyperior. Rotom-W appreciates Moltres's ability to pressure Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Wallbreakers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/entei\" hreflang=\"en\">Entei</a>, and Nidoking appreciate Rotom-W's Volt Switch allowing them to pressure defensive cores relying on Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> and Tangrowth. Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Zarude can help remove Seismitoad and Gastrodon and patch any weaknesses against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zygarde-10\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde-10%</a>. Zarude also forms a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W and appreciates Rotom-W sponging Krookodile's Knock Off if its item is still required, this being particularly important for Choice Scarf variants.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Rotom-Wash","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/rotom-wash","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":107},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":107},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":86}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"pokemonFormTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:33.3740662Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Volt Switch","moveId":"/moves/volt-switch","moveType":{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":70,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User switches out after damaging the target."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Hydro Pump","moveId":"/moves/hydro-pump","moveType":{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":110,"moveAccuracy":80,"moveDetails":"No additional effect."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Pain Split","moveId":"/moves/pain-split","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Shares HP of user and target equally."}],"strategyFourthMoves":[{"moveName":"Will-O-Wisp","moveId":"/moves/will-o-wisp","moveType":{"typeName":"Fire","typeId":"/types/fire"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":85,"moveDetails":"Burns the target."},{"moveName":"Defog","moveId":"/moves/defog","moveType":{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"-1 evasion; clears terrain and hazards on both sides."}]}}
