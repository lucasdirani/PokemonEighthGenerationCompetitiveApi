{"strategyName":"Utility","strategyId":"/strategies/utility?pokemon=excadrill&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Earthquake and Iron Head provide fantastic coverage for Excadrill, slamming common threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a>. Rapid Spin benefits from Excadrill matching up well against other entry hazard setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>. Stealth Rock can be run for more role compression thanks to Excadrill pressuring entry hazard control like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a>. Additionally, Excadrill can set up Stealth Rock against threats like Jirachi and Nihilego because of its typing. Toxic is an alternative option to cripple defensive checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>, though finding another Pokemon to run Stealth Rock can strain teambuilding. Additionally, Toxic is useless against other Excadrill answers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>. Mold Breaker bypasses Levitate from Rotom-W, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, allowing Excadrill to severely damage them with Earthquake while also allowing Excadrill to circumvent Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Maximum Attack investment lets Excadrill threaten Aegislash and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> as much as possible, though maximum investment in Special Defense in an option to better check threats like Hatterene, Aegislash, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a> via directly switching in.</p>\n<p>Excadrill both removing and setting entry hazards gives it a place on many bulky offense and balance teams. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> is a great partner that can remove Flying-types like Skarmory, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, and Moltres that hinder Excadrill. Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can switch into Water- and Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> for Excadrill. Fighting-type checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and Slowking provide great support against threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/cobalion\" hreflang=\"en\">Cobalion</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a>, with Salamence also beating Grass-types like Zarude and Tangrowth as well as helping Excadrill keep entry hazards off the field thanks to it beating entry hazard setters it struggles with like Skarmory and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>. Other entry hazard setters like Nihilego and Cobalion can cover setting Stealth Rock for Excadrill, freeing up a moveslot to run Toxic. They also appreciate Excadrill threatening Aegislash for them. Fast offensive threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zygarde-10\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde-10%</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salazzle\" hreflang=\"en\">Salazzle</a> appreciate Excadrill's support and can deal with faster threats like Thundurus-T and Hydreigon. The latter two also check Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Skarmory.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Excadrill","pokemonId":"/pokemon/excadrill","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":135},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":88}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Mold Breaker","abilityId":"/abilities/mold-breaker","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves and their effects ignore the Abilities of other Pokemon."},{"abilityName":"Sand Force","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-force","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Ground/Rock/Steel attacks do 1.3x in Sandstorm; immunity to it."},{"abilityName":"Sand Rush","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-rush","abilityDetails":"If Sandstorm is active, this Pokemon's Speed is doubled; immunity to Sandstorm."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:38.2264715Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Mold Breaker","abilityId":"/abilities/mold-breaker","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves and their effects ignore the Abilities of other Pokemon."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Earthquake","moveId":"/moves/earthquake","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Hits adjacent Pokemon.
