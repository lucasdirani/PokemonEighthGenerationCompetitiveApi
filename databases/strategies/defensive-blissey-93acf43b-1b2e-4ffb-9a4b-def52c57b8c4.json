{"strategyName":"Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive?pokemon=blissey&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Seismic Toss lets Blissey deal consistent damage to most foes. Soft-Boiled keeps Blissey healthy throughout the game and allows it to check special attackers. Thunder Wave is preferred, as it punishes Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>. However, Toxic can be used to cripple setup sweepers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a>; it also deters physical attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hawlucha\" hreflang=\"en\">Hawlucha</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a> from directly switching into Blissey. Teleport lets Blissey pivot against special attackers to facilitate momentum for offensive teammates.</p>\n<p>Blissey fits well on teams such as bulky offense and balance, as it checks dangerous special attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> and Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> and generates momentum against them. Offensive wallbreakers like Choice Specs Kyurem, Nidoking, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a> appreciate being safely brought in via Blissey's Teleport, as they normally have trouble switching in due to their poor defensive typing and stats. Due to its access to Teleport, Blissey is able to form a pivoting core with partners such as Landorus-T and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>. Corviknight in particular has great synergy with Blissey, as it is able to check physical wallbreakers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and Landorus-T, while Blissey is able to check special attackers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> and Volcarona for it. Blissey is easily pressured by physical attackers such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Landorus-T; therefore, physically defensive walls such as the aforementioned Corviknight, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> are good partners. In return, Blissey checks special wallbreakers such as Kyurem and Nidoking for them. Blissey is also great on more passive teams because of its ability to check the majority of special attackers. Unlike other common specially defensive walls seen on bulky offense teams like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>, and Heatran, Blissey is an amazing long-term check to key offensive threats like Tapu Koko and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Blissey","pokemonId":"/pokemon/blissey","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":255},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":10},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":10},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":135},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":55}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Natural Cure","abilityId":"/abilities/natural-cure","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon has its non-volatile status condition cured when it switches out."},{"abilityName":"Serene Grace","abilityId":"/abilities/serene-grace","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves have their secondary effect chance doubled."},{"abilityName":"Healer","abilityId":"/abilities/healer","abilityDetails":"30% chance of curing an adjacent ally's status at the end of each turn."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:36.1278323Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Natural Cure","abilityId":"/abilities/natural-cure","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon has its non-volatile status condition cured when it switches out."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Bold","natureId":"/natures/bold","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Seismic Toss","moveId":"/moves/seismic-toss","moveType":{"typeName":"Fighting","typeId":"/types/fighting"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Does damage equal to the user's level."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Soft-Boiled","moveId":"/moves/soft-boiled","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Heals the user by 50% of its max HP."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Thunder Wave","moveId":"/moves/thunder-wave","moveType":{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Paralyzes the target."},{"moveName":"Toxic","moveId":"/moves/toxic","moveType":{"typeName":"Poison","typeId":"/types/poison"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Badly poisons the target.
