  "strategyDetails": "Seismic Toss lets Blissey deal consistent damage to most foes. Soft-Boiled keeps Blissey healthy throughout the game and allows it to check special attackers. Thunder Wave is preferred, as it punishes Pokemon such as Heatran, Clefable, and Kartana. However, Toxic can be used to cripple setup sweepers such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Volcarona; it also deters physical attackers such as Hawlucha and Urshifu-R from directly switching into Blissey. Teleport lets Blissey pivot against special attackers to facilitate momentum for offensive teammates. Blissey fits well on teams such as bulky offense and balance, as it checks dangerous special attackers such as Nidoking and Choice Specs Kyurem and generates momentum against them. Offensive wallbreakers like Choice Specs Kyurem, Nidoking, and Tapu Lele appreciate being safely brought in via Blissey's Teleport, as they normally have trouble switching in due to their poor defensive typing and stats. Due to its access to Teleport, Blissey is able to form a pivoting core with partners such as Landorus-T and Corviknight. Corviknight in particular has great synergy with Blissey, as it is able to check physical wallbreakers such as Rillaboom and Landorus-T, while Blissey is able to check special attackers like Tapu Koko and Volcarona for it. Blissey is easily pressured by physical attackers such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Landorus-T; therefore, physically defensive walls such as the aforementioned Corviknight, Zapdos, and Toxapex are good partners. In return, Blissey checks special wallbreakers such as Kyurem and Nidoking for them. Blissey is also great on more passive teams because of its ability to check the majority of special attackers. Unlike other common specially defensive walls seen on bulky offense teams like Slowking, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, Blissey is an amazing long-term check to key offensive threats like Tapu Koko and Dragapult.",
