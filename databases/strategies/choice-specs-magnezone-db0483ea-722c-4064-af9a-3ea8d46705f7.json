{"strategyName":"Choice Specs","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-specs?pokemon=magnezone&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Choice Specs Magnezone goes all in with its massive Special Attack stat to hit as hard as possible while still trapping important targets. Its decently powerful STAB moves combined with Choice Specs and a Modest nature make it very hard to wall, as Electric-type answers without reliable recovery such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> cannot switch into Flash Cannon reliably. Volt Switch is an incredible tool for Magnezone, allowing it to pivot around special walls such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> to bring in stronger wallbreakers against them and chip them for itself later. Its Volt Switch is also very spammable because Flash Cannon deters Ground-types from switching in. Toxic is an unfavorable move to be locked into but is a great midground option against potential switch-ins like specially defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>. Body Press lets Magnezone pick off Ferrothorn and Blissey after they've been chipped, and Steel Beam is a very high-risk, high-reward option that can even take down tanks such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking after they've been chipped. Magnezone is fine sacrificing itself with recoil after doing its trapping job. A Modest nature gives Magnezone a big general boost in power and more favorable damage rolls, such as always 2HKOing specially defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a> with Flash Cannon. A Timid nature, however, allows Magnezone to outspeed some targets such as defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> are all great VoltTurn partners to let Magnezone continually switch in, especially Rillaboom, which baits in Steel-types for Magnezone to trap. Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gastrodon\" hreflang=\"en\">Gastrodon</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, and Blissey are some of the toughest walls for this set to break, meaning teammates that can bait in and damage them are greatly appreciated. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> is a VoltTurn partner that baits them in to chip them down, and mixed Hex <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a> is another pivot that burns Ferrothorn and dents Blissey with Dragon Darts instead.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Magnezone","pokemonId":"/pokemon/magnezone","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":115},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":60}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sturdy","abilityId":"/abilities/sturdy","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon is at full HP, it survives one hit with at least 1 HP.
