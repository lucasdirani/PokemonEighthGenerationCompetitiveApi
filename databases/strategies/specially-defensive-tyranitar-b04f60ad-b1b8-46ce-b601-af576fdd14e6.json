{"strategyName":"Specially Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/specially-defensive?pokemon=tyranitar&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Tyranitar's ability to pressure common forms of entry hazard removal such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> makes it a great Stealth Rock user. Rock Blast is the STAB move of choice, as it has higher PP and accuracy than Stone Edge. Also, it helps against Substitute users like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a>. Earthquake OHKOes <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> while dealing good damage to <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/bisharp\" hreflang=\"en\">Bisharp</a>, and opposing Tyranitar. Thunder Wave cripples defensive switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, while Toxic can be used to put Ground-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a> on a timer. Leftovers provide passive recovery, increasing Tyranitar's longevity; on the other hand, Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to prevent Tyranitar from being worn down by entry hazards.</p>\n<p>Flying-types like Corviknight and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> can deal with Grass- and Ground-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, Landorus-T, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> for Tyranitar, and both of them enjoy Tyranitar checking Heatran and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a>. Corviknight provides Defog support to prevent Tyranitar from being worn down by entry hazards, while Skarmory can set Spikes to form a hazard-stacking core with great defensive synergy. Nasty Plot Tornadus-T is noteworthy, as it can lure in Zapdos and smack it with a Rock-type Weather Ball under sand, which helps Tyranitar to keep Stealth Rock on the field. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a> can deal with Ground-, Water-, and Fighting-types that plague Tyranitar, such as Landorus-T, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/barraskewda\" hreflang=\"en\">Barraskewda</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>, and it can bring Tyranitar in safely via Teleport. Similarly, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> can check some threats that Tyranitar can't such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a> and Clefable while providing a secondary check to Heatran. Both Slowbro and Slowking enjoy Tyranitar's ability to check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a> and Volcarona. Moreover, they can bring in sand wallbreakers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> and especially <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dracozolt\" hreflang=\"en\">Dracozolt</a> safely with Teleport, and also both of them can use Future Sight, which is great to wear down opposing Pokemon for said wallbreakers. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> checks Ground-, Grass-, and Water-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rillaboom, and Barraskewda, and it lures in Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos, which Tyranitar can set Stealth Rock on or cripple with status effects. Sand sweepers like Excadrill, Dracozolt, and Sand Veil Garchomp appreciate Tyranitar's sand and Stealth Rock support to wear down their checks for a late-game sweep. Excadrill also provides Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards and boost its own Speed simultaneously.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Tyranitar","pokemonId":"/pokemon/tyranitar","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Rock","typeId":"/types/rock"},{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":134},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":61}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sand Stream","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-stream","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Sandstorm."},{"abilityName":"Unnerve","abilityId":"/abilities/unnerve","abilityDetails":"While this Pokemon is active, it prevents opposing Pokemon from using their Berries."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:49.1519643Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."},{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sand Stream","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-stream","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Sandstorm."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Careful","natureId":"/natures/careful","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Stealth Rock","moveId":"/moves/stealth-rock","moveType":{"typeName":"Rock","typeId":"/types/rock"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Hurts foes on switch-in.
