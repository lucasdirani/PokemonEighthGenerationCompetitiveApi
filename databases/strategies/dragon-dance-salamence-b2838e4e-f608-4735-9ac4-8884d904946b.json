{"strategyName":"Dragon Dance","strategyId":"/strategies/dragon-dance?pokemon=salamence&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>At +1 Speed, Salamence outspeeds revenge killers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>, and Choice Scarf <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>. At +2 Speed, it blows past even faster revenge killers such as Choice Scarf <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>. +1 Outrage destroys many neutral targets like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom</a> formes and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>, though there is always the risk of Fairy-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> revenge killing Salamence. +1 Dual Wingbeat OHKOes targets such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> after Stealth Rock. Dual Wingbeat also has the benefit of hitting <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> through Substitute, though risking a burn from Scald is not ideal. Earthquake OHKOes <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> at +2. Fire Blast can be used instead to lure in and break through <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> and increase Salamence's chances for a Moxie sweep. Life Orb can be used to OHKO Pokemon such as Aegislash with +1 Earthquake and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> with +2 Dual Wingbeat. It can also be used alongside a Naive nature to ensure that Fire Blast OHKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock. However, Salamence's Stealth Rock weakness and Life Orb recoil will quickly put it into range for Mienshao's Stone Edge and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a>'s Accelerock. Moxie helps Salamence get multiple boosts to KO bulky targets like Aegislash and makes it more difficult to revenge kill.</p>\n<p>This set fits on offense and hyper offense teams as a wallbreaker or late-game cleaner with Moxie. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> is an excellent lead that sets Stealth Rock to wear down bulky Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> and provides Rapid Spin. Sticky Web from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ribombee\" hreflang=\"en\">Ribombee</a> lets Salamence outspeed foes such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> walls this set, so early-game wallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Thundurus-T and Azelf are decent options. They also appreciate Salamence's ability to threaten <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>. Other teammates that overwhelm physically bulky Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/quagsire\" hreflang=\"en\">Quagsire</a> and Skarmory, such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a> and Aegislash are valuable assets to this set. They also heavily benefit Salamence by overwhelming checks like Amoonguss and Primarina. Pivots such as Jirachi and Zarude can position Salamence to set up on Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a> is a consistent revenge killer against Salamence, so teammates that KO it such as Azumarill are appreciated.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Salamence","pokemonId":"/pokemon/salamence","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":135},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":100}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."},{"abilityName":"Moxie","abilityId":"/abilities/moxie","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Attack is raised by 1 stage if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:33.7182631Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."},{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Moxie","abilityId":"/abilities/moxie","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Attack is raised by 1 stage if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}},{"natureName":"Naive","natureId":"/natures/naive","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Dragon Dance","moveId":"/moves/dragon-dance","moveType":{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Attack and Speed by 1."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Outrage","moveId":"/moves/outrage","moveType":{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":120,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Lasts 2-3 turns.
