{"strategyName":"Choice Specs","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-specs?pokemon=primarina&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Psychic does copious amounts of damage to would-be checks in <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a>. After Stealth Rock, Amoonguss risks being OHKOed. Scald is used as a reliable Water-type move when risking Hydro Pump is unnecessary. It also has a 30% chance to burn switch-ins, making it so Primarina can take physical attacks a bit better and wear down Amoonguss, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, and Tentacruel. A Modest nature lets Primarina 2HKO Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> with Hydro Pump.</p>\n<p>This set aims to punch holes through the raw power of Primarina's Choice Specs-boosted moves. Pivots such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> can bring in Primarina safely with U-turn in front of Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/entei\" hreflang=\"en\">Entei</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a>, making up for its low Speed. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chandelure\" hreflang=\"en\">Chandelure</a> beats Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth, and some variants pressure <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> for Primarina. Ground-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/seismitoad\" hreflang=\"en\">Seismitoad</a> handle Electric-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> and set Stealth Rock up to help Primarina wallbreak. Chansey walls Primarina effortlessly, so Fighting-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a> and Kommo-o can be used to threaten it. Primarina can be easily worn down by entry hazards, so a Wish passer like Jirachi can help it stay in the match for longer. In the same vein, entry hazard removers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> extend Primarina's longevity.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Primarina","pokemonId":"/pokemon/primarina","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":74},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":74},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":126},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":116},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":60}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Torrent","abilityId":"/abilities/torrent","abilityDetails":"At 1/3 or less of its max HP, this Pokemon's attacking stat is 1.5x with Water attacks."},{"abilityName":"Liquid Voice","abilityId":"/abilities/liquid-voice","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's sound-based moves become Water type."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:32.2935198Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Specs","itemId":"/items/choice-specs","itemDetails":"Holder's Sp.
