{"strategyName":"Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive?pokemon=landorus-therian&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Defensive Landorus-T is a great Stealth Rock setter by virtue of its good typing and Intimidate, which help it switch into many physical attackers including <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> to sponge hits. U-turn allows it to safely pivot out against checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a>, and opposing Landorus-T as well as keep up momentum during a match. Knock Off cripples any Pokemon that switches in by removing their item; this makes Landorus-T much more annoying to switch into. Removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> is especially useful, as it leaves them vulnerable to Landorus-T's Stealth Rock. Toxic is an alternative that cripples Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, and opposing Landorus-T. It's also especially useful for pressuring Defoggers such as the aforementioned Tornadus-T and Mandibuzz. Leftovers provides Landorus-T with passive recovery, which somewhat mitigates its problem with longevity. 92 Speed EVs are used to outspeed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/bisharp\" hreflang=\"en\">Bisharp</a> and specially defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> as well as positive-natured base 60s such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> can switch into strong special attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/latios\" hreflang=\"en\">Latios</a> that easily overwhelm Landorus-T. It also generally covers Landorus-T's Water and Ice weaknesses. Similarly, Slowbro can also cover these weaknesses while also alleviating some of the pressure from Landorus-T in checking physical attackers like Garchomp and Excadrill. Bulky Steel-types like Corviknight and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> are good partners, as they can take on the aforementioned Psychic-types. Bulk Up Corviknight can also alleviate pressure against physical attackers like Garchomp, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, while Ferrothorn is a good Water-resistant teammate that can form a hazard-stacking duo with Landorus-T. Furthermore, Landorus-T can cripple Bulk Up Corviknight's checks such as Zapdos and Slowbro with Knock Off or Toxic. Offensive Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a> and Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> appreciate being brought in safely by Landorus-T's U-turn, especially against switch-ins like Slowbro and Tangrowth. They also appreciate its Stealth Rock support and ability to cripple their defensive answers with Knock Off or Toxic. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a> is another good teammate that appreciates being brought in safely by U-turn against Landorus-T's switch-ins, such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos, to get a chance to set up or freely throw out an attack.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Landorus-Therian","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/landorus-therian","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":89},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":145},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":91}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."}],"pokemonFormTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:41.4443904Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Impish","natureId":"/natures/impish","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":164},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":92}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Stealth Rock","moveId":"/moves/stealth-rock","moveType":{"typeName":"Rock","typeId":"/types/rock"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Hurts foes on switch-in.
