  "strategyDetails": "Defensive Landorus-T is a great Stealth Rock setter by virtue of its good typing and Intimidate, which help it switch into many physical attackers including Garchomp and Excadrill to sponge hits. U-turn allows it to safely pivot out against checks like Corviknight, Hippowdon, and opposing Landorus-T as well as keep up momentum during a match. Knock Off cripples any Pokemon that switches in by removing their item; this makes Landorus-T much more annoying to switch into. Removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Mandibuzz is especially useful, as it leaves them vulnerable to Landorus-T's Stealth Rock. Toxic is an alternative that cripples Pokemon like Tangrowth, Slowbro, and opposing Landorus-T. It's also especially useful for pressuring Defoggers such as the aforementioned Tornadus-T and Mandibuzz. Leftovers provides Landorus-T with passive recovery, which somewhat mitigates its problem with longevity. 92 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Bisharp and specially defensive Heatran as well as positive-natured base 60s such as Magnezone and Aegislash. Slowking can switch into strong special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Latios that easily overwhelm Landorus-T. It also generally covers Landorus-T's Water and Ice weaknesses. Similarly, Slowbro can also cover these weaknesses while also alleviating some of the pressure from Landorus-T in checking physical attackers like Garchomp and Excadrill. Bulky Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn are good partners, as they can take on the aforementioned Psychic-types. Bulk Up Corviknight can also alleviate pressure against physical attackers like Garchomp, Kartana, and Rillaboom, while Ferrothorn is a good Water-resistant teammate that can form a hazard-stacking duo with Landorus-T. Furthermore, Landorus-T can cripple Bulk Up Corviknight's checks such as Zapdos and Slowbro with Knock Off or Toxic. Offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult and Choice Specs Kyurem appreciate being brought in safely by Landorus-T's U-turn, especially against switch-ins like Slowbro and Tangrowth. They also appreciate its Stealth Rock support and ability to cripple their defensive answers with Knock Off or Toxic. Weavile is another good teammate that appreciates being brought in safely by U-turn against Landorus-T's switch-ins, such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos, to get a chance to set up or freely throw out an attack.",
