{"strategyName":"Defensive Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive-pivot?pokemon=swampert&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Stealth Rock is used to capitalize on Swampert's ability to force switches against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a>. Flip Turn generates momentum against Grass- and Water-type switch-ins and can safely bring in teammates that threaten out Defoggers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>. Toxic is used to punish Defoggers and bulky Water-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, as well as common Grass-type switch-ins such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>. High Horsepower may be used over Earthquake to avoid Grassy Terrain's damage reduction, but it may result in Swampert taking more chip damage from Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, and Flame Body. Damp prevents the use of Explosion on hyper offense lead Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/regieleki\" hreflang=\"en\">Regieleki</a>.</p>\n<p>Swampert fits very well on bulky offense and balance teams, where it can be used as a Stealth Rock setter and pivot that can chip opposing teams and generate momentum. Swampert can use its slow Flip Turn against bulky Grass- and Water-types such as Tangrowth and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> to safely bring in powerful wallbreakers like Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blacephalon\" hreflang=\"en\">Blacephalon</a>, Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, and Choice Band Rillaboom. Corviknight is an excellent partner since it appreciates Swampert's ability to switch into Fire- and Electric-type moves such as Magma Storm, Flamethrower, Volt Switch, and Thunderbolt, while Corviknight can be used to switch into many Grass-types that threaten Swampert and forms a pivoting core with it that is great at maintaining momentum. Other Flying-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> can also be used to offensively threaten Grass- and Water-types, which may be a nuisance for Swampert. Grass-type Knock Off users such as Rillaboom and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> appreciate the Stealth Rock and Toxic chip damage Swampert provides against Flying-type Defoggers that usually switch into them. Swampert also benefits from Rillaboom's Grassy Surge providing it with an extra round of recovery per turn, though it is important to run High Horsepower over Earthquake to prevent damage reduction.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Swampert","pokemonId":"/pokemon/swampert","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":60}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Torrent","abilityId":"/abilities/torrent","abilityDetails":"At 1/3 or less of its max HP, this Pokemon's attacking stat is 1.5x with Water attacks."},{"abilityName":"Damp","abilityId":"/abilities/damp","abilityDetails":"Prevents Explosion/Mind Blown/Misty Explosion/Self-Destruct/Aftermath while active."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:46.2611837Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Damp","abilityId":"/abilities/damp","abilityDetails":"Prevents Explosion/Mind Blown/Misty Explosion/Self-Destruct/Aftermath while active."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Sassy","natureId":"/natures/sassy","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":0}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Stealth Rock","moveId":"/moves/stealth-rock","moveType":{"typeName":"Rock","typeId":"/types/rock"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Hurts foes on switch-in.
