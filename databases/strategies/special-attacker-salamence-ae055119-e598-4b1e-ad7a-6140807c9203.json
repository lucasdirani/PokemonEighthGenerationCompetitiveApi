{"strategyName":"Special Attacker","strategyId":"/strategies/special-attacker?pokemon=salamence&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Draco Meteor helps Salamence revenge kill <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a> and deals solid damage to neutral targets like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a>. Hurricane 2HKOes Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and has a significant chance to OHKO <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> after Stealth Rock. Defog can be used over either STAB move, though this sacrifices neutral coverage against Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>. Flamethrower is solid coverage against Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and can finish off weakened targets such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heracross\" hreflang=\"en\">Heracross</a> without risking a Hurricane miss. Roost alongside Heavy-Duty Boots makes Salamence harder to wear down by threats like Jirachi and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>. Intimidate makes Salamence a more reliable switch-in to threats such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> while making them easier to pivot around.</p>\n<p>This set fits on bulky offense and balance teams for its wallbreaking capabilities against Pokemon like Amoonguss and important defensive utility against other foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a>. Swampert and Excadrill are able to break through Salamence's checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diancie\" hreflang=\"en\">Diancie</a> and Nihilego, provide Stealth Rock support to soften up defensive Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, and capitalize on support against Tangrowth. Excadrill also pressures <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/togekiss\" hreflang=\"en\">Togekiss</a> and provides Rapid Spin support so Salamence can drop Defog. Aegislash is a very effective partner that is able to break through <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> and check Diancie. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> takes advantage of Salamence removing potential roadblocks such as Amoonguss, and it threatens Stealth Rock setters Salamence has troubles against like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> and Nihilego. Rotom-H and Rotom-W are effective pivots to safely bring Salamence into foes such as Hydreigon and Tangrowth, and they also provide Defog support. Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a> helps deal with checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> and Hatterene. Slowking provides Teleport so Salamence can safely enter on Grass-types, as well as providing a stronger backbone against Conkeldurr with Colbur Berry. Choice Scarf users such as Jirachi and Mienshao can handle faster Pokemon such as Nihilego and Lycanroc-D.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Salamence","pokemonId":"/pokemon/salamence","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":135},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":100}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."},{"abilityName":"Moxie","abilityId":"/abilities/moxie","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Attack is raised by 1 stage if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:33.7162736Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Draco Meteor","moveId":"/moves/draco-meteor","moveType":{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":130,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Lowers the user's Sp.
