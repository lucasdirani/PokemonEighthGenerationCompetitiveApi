{"strategyName":"Choice Scarf","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-scarf?pokemon=tapu-fini&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>With a Choice Scarf, Tapu Fini can outspeed and threaten Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>. Trick cripples <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a>, which can switch into Tapu Fini's attacks with ease, and this can help teammates break through them. Taunt might look like a strange choice on a Choice item set, but it prevents Toxapex and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> from pivoting into it freely and bulky setup sweepers like bulky <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragonite\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragonite</a> from setting up on it. Defog can be used instead on teams that require situational hazard control. 216 Speed EVs are used to outspeed +1 Dragonite, but the EV spread is customizable; for example, maximum defensive investment can be used if a team has another revenge killer, and Special Attack EVs can allow Tapu Fini to OHKO Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a> and Dragapult.</p>\n<p>This set fits on offensive teams that do not require Tapu Fini's full defensive utility and appreciate the role compression of a revenge killer, situational switch-in to Pokemon like Dragapult, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>, and Weavile, and potential Defogger. Pokemon that take advantage of Tapu Fini's ability to lure in and cripple Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Toxapex, such as Volcarona and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T—which also help against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>—are ideal teammates. Ferrothorn can set Spikes to wear down opposing Pokemon into Tapu Fini's KO range and pressure Water-types like Slowking. It also switches into <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> for it. Ground-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and Garchomp can switch into Tapu Koko and Galarian Slowking, and they like Tapu Fini's ability to check Weavile and Urshifu-R.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Tapu Fini","pokemonId":"/pokemon/tapu-fini","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":115},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":85}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Telepathy","abilityId":"/abilities/telepathy","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon does not take damage from attacks made by its allies."},{"abilityName":"Misty Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/misty-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Misty Terrain."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:46.8894258Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Scarf","itemId":"/items/choice-scarf","itemDetails":"Holder's Speed is 1.5x, but it can only select the first move it executes."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Misty Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/misty-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Misty Terrain."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":248},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":44},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":216}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Scald","moveId":"/moves/scald","moveType":{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"30% chance to burn the target.
