{"strategyName":"Paper Plane","strategyId":"/strategies/paper-plane?pokemon=kartana&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Utilizing a Choice Scarf, Kartana becomes a deadly late-game cleaner and revenge killer at the cost of being considerably weaker. It can use Knock Off to help weaken shared defensive checks for wallbreaking teammates like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/bisharp\" hreflang=\"en\">Bisharp</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>. Sacred Sword nails Steel-types that would otherwise wall Kartana, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>. Although most Kartana prefer Smart Strike for its reliable damage, some offensive teams opt for Defog as an emergency way to remove entry hazards on forced switches. A Jolly nature and a Choice Scarf let it outspeed other Choice Scarf Pokemon, including <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, and Speed-boosted sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a> to revenge kill them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a> is Choice Scarf Kartana's most common partner because of its ability to trap annoying Steel-type checks, including Ferrothorn, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> that would otherwise wall it and its teammates. As Choice Scarf Kartana has problems beating walls without prior Beast Boost activations; therefore, wallbreaking teammates like Bisharp and Tapu Lele can help remove obstacles like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and Corviknight for it to clean up. Garchomp is an especially great partner because it can help chip and remove common Flying-type checks, as well as threatening opposing Pokemon that could come in on Choice-locked Kartana, like Heatran and Volcarona.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Kartana","pokemonId":"/pokemon/kartana","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":59},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":181},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":131},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":59},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":31},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":109}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Beast Boost","abilityId":"/abilities/beast-boost","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's highest stat is raised by 1 if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:40.6600516Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Scarf","itemId":"/items/choice-scarf","itemDetails":"Holder's Speed is 1.5x, but it can only select the first move it executes."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Beast Boost","abilityId":"/abilities/beast-boost","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's highest stat is raised by 1 if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Leaf Blade","moveId":"/moves/leaf-blade","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"High critical hit ratio."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Knock Off","moveId":"/moves/knock-off","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":65,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"1.5x damage if foe holds an item.
