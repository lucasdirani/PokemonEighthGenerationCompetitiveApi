{"strategyName":"Choice Scarf","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-scarf?pokemon=rotom-wash&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Choice Scarf <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom</a> is effective at revenge killing targets like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/entei\" hreflang=\"en\">Entei</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> with Hydro Pump. Volt Switch helps Rotom-W offensively threaten foes such as +1 <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/starmie\" hreflang=\"en\">Starmie</a>. Thunderbolt can be used over Volt Switch to apply more reliable pressure against foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mantine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mantine</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a>, although Volt Switch is more consistent. Defog allows Rotom-W to remove entry hazards before being KOed or as it forces out Pokemon like Mantine and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>. Pain Split over Defog gives Rotom-W more longevity. However, finding other options for entry hazard removal can be challenging and create more strain on teambuilding. Trick is vital because it cripples defensive pivots such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>. However, Rotom-W should only use Trick after the additional Speed is no longer necessary, as it will no longer be able to outspeed threats such as Lycanroc-D and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zygarde-10\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde-10%</a>. Choice Scarf allows Rotom-W to revenge kill threats such as Lycanroc-D and Krookodile as well as maintain momentum against other Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed and deal massive damage such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>. The additional speed also helps Rotom-W scout and maintain momentum against unfavorable matchups such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/roserade\" hreflang=\"en\">Roserade</a> more reliably.</p>\n<p>Choice Scarf Rotom-W fits best on offense, balance, and bulky offense teams that appreciate its role compression as a Ground-immune offensive pivot and revenge killer that provides momentum and emergency entry hazard removal. Other pivots such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a> form a potent VoltTurn core with Rotom-W, as they overwhelm each other's checks; Mienshao deals with Chansey and Zarude, while Rotom-W deals with Moltres and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>. Entry hazard setters such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>, Nihilego, and Krookodile wear down targets for Rotom-W. The former is able to form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W, while the latter two can cripple Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and Salamence with Knock Off. Wallbreakers such as Entei, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a> are fantastic partner that break through Pokemon Rotom-W grants them safe entry on, such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> deals with Pokemon that would otherwise take advantage of Rotom-W like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/seismitoad\" hreflang=\"en\">Seismitoad</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a>. Hatterene's Magic Bounce also assists Rotom-W in its role as entry hazard control and makes Rotom-W more comfortable with running Pain Split. Rotom-W's role compression means it can struggle against Entei and Jirachi in the long-term, so teammates such as RestTalk <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>, Aegislash, and Moltres help relieve pressure.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Rotom-Wash","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/rotom-wash","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":107},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":107},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":86}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"pokemonFormTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:33.3763173Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Scarf","itemId":"/items/choice-scarf","itemDetails":"Holder's Speed is 1.5x, but it can only select the first move it executes."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Hydro Pump","moveId":"/moves/hydro-pump","moveType":{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":110,"moveAccuracy":80,"moveDetails":"No additional effect."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Volt Switch","moveId":"/moves/volt-switch","moveType":{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":70,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User switches out after damaging the target."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Defog","moveId":"/moves/defog","moveType":{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"-1 evasion; clears terrain and hazards on both sides."}],"strategyFourthMoves":[{"moveName":"Trick","moveId":"/moves/trick","moveType":{"typeName":"Psychic","typeId":"/types/psychic"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User switches its held item with the target's."}]}}
