{"strategyName":"Paper Cut","strategyId":"/strategies/paper-cut?pokemon=kartana&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Swords Dance Kartana is a premier wallbreaker because of its immense power. Its ability to steamroll its common Flying-type checks when boosted or slowly whittle them down with Knock Off and entry hazard support makes it nearly uncheckable. Knock Off targets Flying-type switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, as well as hitting <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a>. By removing their items, Kartana ensures that it or one of its teammates has an easier time breaking through later. Sacred Sword lets it break through Steel-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> more easily. Sacred Sword also lets Kartana beat Iron Defense <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> by bypassing their Defense boosts. Synthesis is an alternative to ensure Kartana defeats Corviknight while healing off Life Orb recoil. It is especially valuable on bulkier teams, where Kartana can be useful even after eliminating Corviknight. However, forgoing Sacred Sword results in harder matchups against other Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed and possibly revenge kill common offensive threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>. Life Orb is especially useful when trying to break through common defensive walls like Corviknight, Zapdos, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>.</p>\n<p>Swords Dance Kartana is often used on offensive teams because of its unparalleled ability to break through Corviknight, Tangrowth, and Skarmory for other cleaners like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and Garchomp. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a> supports it well because it can trap Corviknight and Skarmory, enabling an easy Kartana sweep. On bulky offense teams, Heatran can set Stealth Rock to help chip common checks, including Corviknight and Tangrowth, and easily pressure Grass- and Steel-types. Cleaners like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragonite\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragonite</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hawlucha\" hreflang=\"en\">Hawlucha</a>, alongside the aforementioned ones, can benefit from Kartana's wallbreaking ability on hyper offense teams, often with dual screens support from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> or <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/regieleki\" hreflang=\"en\">Regieleki</a>.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Kartana","pokemonId":"/pokemon/kartana","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":59},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":181},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":131},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":59},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":31},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":109}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Beast Boost","abilityId":"/abilities/beast-boost","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's highest stat is raised by 1 if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:40.6552532Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Beast Boost","abilityId":"/abilities/beast-boost","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's highest stat is raised by 1 if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Swords Dance","moveId":"/moves/swords-dance","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Attack by 2."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Leaf Blade","moveId":"/moves/leaf-blade","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"High critical hit ratio."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Knock Off","moveId":"/moves/knock-off","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":65,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"1.5x damage if foe holds an item.
