{"strategyName":"Unburden Sweeper","strategyId":"/strategies/unburden-sweeper?pokemon=hawlucha&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Swords Dance turns Hawlucha into a fearsome cleaner when combined with the Speed boost provided by Unburden. Stone Edge allows it to break through <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, which otherwise could wall it; however, Taunt allows it to defeat certain walls, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/quagsire\" hreflang=\"en\">Quagsire</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a>, by disabling their recovery moves at the cost of losing against the aforementioned Flying-types. Hawlucha's item is interchangeable depending on its teammates; on hyper offense teams, Hawlucha should run Grassy Seed, while on dual screens teams Electric Seed should be the choice. The Defense boost also allows it to set up more freely against threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>. The given EV spread allows Hawlucha to outspeed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> in sand after Unburden activates, as well as revenge killing threats like +1 <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a> if needed. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to increase chances to survive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>'s Moonblast after Stealth Rock.</p>\n<p>Hawlucha should always be used in tandem with <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> or <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, as their abilities activate its item and therefore Unburden. Rillaboom provides a strong wallbreaker that shares checks with Hawlucha, like Tornadus-T and Zapdos, so they can overwhelm them together. However, Tapu Koko acts as an offensive pivot that can set up screens and deal with walls like Toxapex and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, as well as bringing in Hawlucha against would-be setup fodders like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> with U-turn. As Hawlucha only has one opportunity to clean, it appreciates having all of its checks removed or chipped into KO range; this makes Knock Off support from Kartana and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a> very valuable, as they can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from its checks like Toxapex and Zapdos. Both Kartana and Weavile also share checks with Hawlucha; this allows them to wear them down together and let one clean late-game. They can also pressure some of Hawlucha's checks, like Slowbro and Hippowdon, with their STAB moves. Finally, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a> and Hawlucha can form an offensive core that can be hard to manage. Dragapult pressures key targets like Zapdos or Toxapex and forces damage on them with its powerful STAB moves; it can also offer setup opportunities with U-turn, as it gets forced out by Pokemon that Hawlucha wants to use as setup fodder, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a>.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Hawlucha","pokemonId":"/pokemon/hawlucha","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Fighting","typeId":"/types/fighting"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":78},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":92},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":74},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":63},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":118}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Limber","abilityId":"/abilities/limber","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon cannot be paralyzed.
