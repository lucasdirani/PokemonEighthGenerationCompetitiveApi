{"strategyName":"Utility","strategyId":"/strategies/utility?pokemon=excadrill&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>With these Special Defense EVs, Excadrill can take full advantage of its defensive typing to check special attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> lacking Flamethrower and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>. Stealth Rock is usually the best choice for the third move, as Excadrill can pressure many entry hazard removers with the combination of its STAB moves and Toxic, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>. If Excadrill's team already has a Stealth Rock setter, it can instead use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards. Toxic is typically preferred to cripple Pokemon that do not mind Excadrill's attacks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>. Swords Dance can be used instead to allow Excadrill to sweep late-game and take advantage of Pokemon it checks. It works especially well with the Speed boost of Rapid Spin. Swords Dance does, however, make Excadrill easier to wall without Toxic to punish its checks. Mold Breaker is the chosen ability for this set, as it allows Excadrill to use Earthquake more freely by ignoring Levitate from Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/latios\" hreflang=\"en\">Latios</a>. Although it may seem unusual to use Special Defense EVs over HP EVs on a defensive set, they are most optimal for maximizing Excadrill's special bulk due to its already high base HP and low base Special Defense.</p>\n<p>While Excadrill's typing gives it many useful resistances, it also leaves it vulnerable to common types in the metagame such as Water, Ground, and Fighting. Consequently, a good defensive backbone for it is required. Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>, Tornadus-T, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> are good teammates, as they can check Ground-types for it. The former two can also provide entry hazard removal, allowing Excadrill to run Stealth Rock over Rapid Spin more freely. Clefable and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> are solid checks to Fighting-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hawlucha\" hreflang=\"en\">Hawlucha</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>. They also benefit from Excadrill's ability to check Pokemon like Tapu Koko and prevent strong wallbreakers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a> from freely using their strongest moves. If Excadrill is using Stealth Rock, it often draws in entry hazard removers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz. Consequently, Pokemon that can take advantage of them like Tapu Koko are good teammates. On the other hand, if Excadrill is using Rapid Spin, many offensive Pokemon appreciate being able to pivot in and out of battle more freely, such as Urshifu-R and Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Excadrill","pokemonId":"/pokemon/excadrill","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":135},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":88}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Mold Breaker","abilityId":"/abilities/mold-breaker","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves and their effects ignore the Abilities of other Pokemon."},{"abilityName":"Sand Force","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-force","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Ground/Rock/Steel attacks do 1.3x in Sandstorm; immunity to it."},{"abilityName":"Sand Rush","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-rush","abilityDetails":"If Sandstorm is active, this Pokemon's Speed is doubled; immunity to Sandstorm."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:38.2355985Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Mold Breaker","abilityId":"/abilities/mold-breaker","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves and their effects ignore the Abilities of other Pokemon."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Earthquake","moveId":"/moves/earthquake","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Hits adjacent Pokemon.
