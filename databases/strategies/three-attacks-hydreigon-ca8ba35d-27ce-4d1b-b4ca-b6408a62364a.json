{"strategyName":"Three Attacks","strategyId":"/strategies/three-attacks?pokemon=hydreigon&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Flamethrower breaks through <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a> and pressures <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>. Fire Blast is an option to 2HKO Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth; however, they can be 2HKOed by Flamethrower after Stealth Rock. Flash Cannon can be used to break through Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diancie\" hreflang=\"en\">Diancie</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/togekiss\" hreflang=\"en\">Togekiss</a> while neutrally hitting <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>. However, it doesn't do much damage to bulky variants of Primarina. Roost offsets Life Orb recoil and lets Hydreigon use its defensive typing to check foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>. Life Orb provides the needed damage boost to get through Pokemon like Amoonguss and Celesteela. Leftovers is an alternative that offsets Stealth Rock damage and potential burns from Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>.</p>\n<p>Hydreigon fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that value its wallbreaking power, useful typing, and decent Speed. Hydreigon's greatest hurdles are Fairy-types such as Primarina, Togekiss, and Azumarill, so partners capable of removing them like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> are appreciated. Thundurus-T can also break through <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>, Nihilego and Nidoking can provide Stealth Rock support, and Nihilego is an emergency check to <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a>, which sets up on Hydreigon. In return, Hydreigon can pressure Slowking for Nihilego and Nidoking. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> is a phenomenal partner, switching into most Fairy-types and safely providing Hydreigon opportunities to wallbreak against Pokemon like Aegislash, Rotom-W, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a> with U-turn. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a> and Slowking can check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, which ignores Hydreigon's Levitate, and Fighting-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/cobalion\" hreflang=\"en\">Cobalion</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a>. Slowking can also provide Future Sight to help wear down the Fairy-types that switch into Hydreigon. Conkeldurr is a great partner for Hydreigon, as it can break through their shared checks in Fairy-types and remove Chansey. In return, Hydreigon can pressure physical walls such as Slowking and Amoonguss.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Hydreigon","pokemonId":"/pokemon/hydreigon","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":92},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":98}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:40.2751231Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."},{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Dark Pulse","moveId":"/moves/dark-pulse","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"20% chance to make the target flinch."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Draco Meteor","moveId":"/moves/draco-meteor","moveType":{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":130,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Lowers the user's Sp.
