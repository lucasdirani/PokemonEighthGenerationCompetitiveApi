{"strategyName":"Physically Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/physically-defensive?pokemon=mandibuzz&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Foul Play allows Mandibuzz to hit <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a> for big damage and discourage them from using their setup moves in front of it. Brave Bird lets it hit <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> super effectively. Knock Off punishes switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> by removing their items. Defog can also be used due to its good matchup against certain entry hazard setters such as Excadrill and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>, but Mandibuzz can't beat other setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> or <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diancie\" hreflang=\"en\">Diancie</a>, and struggles longer term versus <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, especially Toxic variants, so it should only be run if absolutely necessary. U-turn lets Mandibuzz pivot out of unfavorable matchups such as Nihilego and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> and bring in a teammate that can threaten them. Overcoat lets Mandibuzz pivot in on Spore and Stun Spore from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/roserade\" hreflang=\"en\">Roserade</a>, though it must be wary of Sludge Bomb poisons. Amoonguss also has more opportunities to fish for them since it has the bulk to take Brave Bird well, unlike Roserade. 96 Speed EVs let Mandibuzz outspeed Modest Primarina and Adamant <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>, with the remaining EVs invested in physical bulk to maximize its ability to take on wallbreakers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zygarde-10\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde-10%</a> and Dragon Dance <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>.</p>\n<p>Mandibuzz is found on bulky offense and balance teams as a solid glue, combining the roles of pivot, mixed wall, and Ghost resist into one teammate. Amoonguss is a great partner that absorbs Knock Off and covers Mandibuzz's matchups against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> and Primarina, while Mandibuzz checks threats such as Salamence and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/necrozma\" hreflang=\"en\">Necrozma</a>; Mandibuzz does have to worry about Meteor Beam from the latter, though. Excadrill can provide Rapid Spin support to free Mandibuzz from running Defog while checking <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> and being a secondary check to Aegislash. Colbur Berry <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a> check threats such as Conkeldurr, Nihilego, and Nidoking, and they appreciate Mandibuzz's ability to check Aegislash and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>. In addition, Mandibuzz forms a pivot core with Slowking. Diancie and Nihilego appreciate Mandibuzz checking Excadrill and Zarude. Their good special bulk lets them pivot into Thundurus-T, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a>, with Diancie providing additional support with Heal Bell. Frail wallbreakers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> and Nidoking struggle to switch in, so they appreciate the slow U-turn Mandibuzz provides.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Mandibuzz","pokemonId":"/pokemon/mandibuzz","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":55},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":80}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Overcoat","abilityId":"/abilities/overcoat","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to powder moves and damage from Sandstorm or Hail."},{"abilityName":"Weak Armor","abilityId":"/abilities/weak-armor","abilityDetails":"If a physical attack hits this Pokemon, Defense is lowered by 1, Speed is raised by 2."},{"abilityName":"Big Pecks","abilityId":"/abilities/big-pecks","abilityDetails":"Prevents other Pokemon from lowering this Pokemon's Defense stat stage."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:42.1711992Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Overcoat","abilityId":"/abilities/overcoat","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to powder moves and damage from Sandstorm or Hail."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Impish","natureId":"/natures/impish","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":248},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":164},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":96}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Foul Play","moveId":"/moves/foul-play","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":95,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Uses target's Attack stat in damage calculation."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Brave Bird","moveId":"/moves/brave-bird","moveType":{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":120,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Has 33% recoil."},{"moveName":"Knock Off","moveId":"/moves/knock-off","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":65,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"1.5x damage if foe holds an item.
