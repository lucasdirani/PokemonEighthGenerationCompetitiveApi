{"strategyName":"Swords Dance","strategyId":"/strategies/swords-dance?pokemon=landorus-therian&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Landorus-T's ability in Intimidate and capability of forcing switches against Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a> give it opportunities to set up with Swords Dance, allowing it to act as a dangerous wallbreaker that can easily overwhelm defensive Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>. Stone Edge is an amazing coverage move that hits Earthquake-immune targets such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>. Substitute eases prediction and allows Landorus-T to avoid Toxic and Leech Seed from Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a> and Ferrothorn. Alternatively, it can use Stealth Rock to take advantage of the switches it forces as well as its ability to threaten most entry hazard removers. While Leftovers provides passive recovery to keep Landorus-T healthy, Salac Berry is an alternative that gives it the chance to clean late-game and works well with Substitute, although it can only be used once and in certain situations, so it's often inferior.</p>\n<p>Offensive Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a> work well with Landorus-T, as they can wear down or remove each other's checks like Corviknight and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> with coverage moves. This Landorus-T set appreciates VoltTurn support, so it pairs well with Pokemon like Tornadus-T and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> that often force in the likes of Heatran, Galarian Slowking, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>, which they can safely pivot against to bring Landorus-T in. Late-game cleaners such as Scale Shot <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> and Swords Dance <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a> take advantage of the significant damage Landorus-T does against most defensive answers. Landorus-T can also be used on hyper offense teams with dual screens support from Pokemon like Tapu Koko and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/regieleki\" hreflang=\"en\">Regieleki</a>. They can also bring it in safely by using U-turn against Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> in the former's case, or by using Explosion in the latter's case.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Landorus-Therian","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/landorus-therian","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":89},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":145},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":91}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."}],"pokemonFormTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:41.4482978Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Swords Dance","moveId":"/moves/swords-dance","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Attack by 2."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Earthquake","moveId":"/moves/earthquake","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Hits adjacent Pokemon.
