{"strategyName":"Defog","strategyId":"/strategies/defog?pokemon=tornadus-therian&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Tornadus-T's amazing ability in Regenerator, Speed tier, and good typing make it an amazing Defogger and consistent check to <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>. Its immense role compression as a Defogger, revenge killer, Grass-type check, pivot, and Knock Off user makes it incredibly versatile and justifiable on almost any team. Knock Off is necessary to remove any form of longevity from common switch-ins, most notably Steel-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a>. Its ability grants it the longevity to spam Knock Off against defensive Pokemon using Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots and pivot with little risk with U-turn on forced switches, clearing the way for teammates to break through walls. Regenerator also gives it more opportunities to use Defog with less fear of chip damage and more pivoting ability.</p>\n<p>Tornadus-T's ability to consistently pivot makes it very effective on momentum-based VoltTurn cores with Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>, especially paired alongside wallbreakers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/crawdaunt\" hreflang=\"en\">Crawdaunt</a> that deal heavy damage when safely switched in. Knock Off's ability to cripple Steel-types and other common specially defensive switch-ins can help specially offensive wallbreakers or sweepers such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele, Calm Mind <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, and Tapu Koko win in the long run. Electric-immune Pokemon such as Landorus-T and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> provide insurance against common checks to Tornadus-T like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> and Tapu Koko. They also provide utility with Stealth Rock that will help whittle down teams after items are removed through Tornadus-T's Knock Off. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a> can also situationally switch into these Electric-types and appreciates Tornadus-T's U-turn support and pressure on Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>. Tornadus-T can provide sweeping opportunities for offensive Landorus-T and Garchomp sets by pivoting out of common Steel-type switch-ins like Heatran and Melmetal and letting Landorus-T or Garchomp set up on a forced switch.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Tornadus-Therian","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/tornadus-therian","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":79},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":121}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Regenerator","abilityId":"/abilities/regenerator","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon restores 1/3 of its maximum HP, rounded down, when it switches out."}],"pokemonFormTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:48.2043561Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Regenerator","abilityId":"/abilities/regenerator","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon restores 1/3 of its maximum HP, rounded down, when it switches out."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Hurricane","moveId":"/moves/hurricane","moveType":{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":110,"moveAccuracy":70,"moveDetails":"30% chance to confuse target.
