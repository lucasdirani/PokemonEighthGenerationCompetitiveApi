{"strategyName":"Utility","strategyId":"/strategies/utility?pokemon=clefable&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Clefable is a great Stealth Rock setter, as it can very easily take advantage of passive Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>. Alternatively, Wish is a very useful move that can be used if Clefable's team already has a Stealth Rock user. It supports teammates such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> by keeping them healthy throughout the game. Knock Off cripples any switch-in by removing its item, especially Leftovers from checks like Heatran or Ferrothorn, which limits their usefulness over the course of the game. While Leftovers provides passive recovery to keep Clefable healthy and allow it to switch into attacks better, Rocky Helmet is an alternative to punish physical attacks such as U-turn from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> that usually want to pivot out against Clefable. 56 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature allow Clefable to live back-to-back uses of Freeze-Dry from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> and Hex from Dragapult with and without Leftovers respectively. The rest of its EVs go into Defense to allow for it to take consecutive hits from Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragonite\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragonite</a>.</p>\n<p>Offensive Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a>, Heatran, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> can often overwhelm Clefable, so checks to them are good teammates. Toxapex can take on Melmetal, and Slowbro and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> are also decent Melmetal checks. Both <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and defensive Landorus-T can take on Rillaboom and other physical attackers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> and opposing Landorus-T that might overwhelm Clefable. Steel-types like Melmetal, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a> can take advantage of this Clefable set, so switch-ins to them make good teammates; Ferrothorn can switch into Melmetal and Rillaboom while also using Spikes to form an entry hazard stacking duo with Clefable, and Slowbro can take on both Melmetal and Excadrill but has to be wary of Toxic. Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp can pressure the aforementioned Steel-types as well as Poison-types such as Toxapex, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> that might switch into Clefable. Specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can form a good defensive core with Clefable by taking on powerful special attackers such as Heatran, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> that Clefable often struggles with.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Clefable","pokemonId":"/pokemon/clefable","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":73},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":60}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Cute Charm","abilityId":"/abilities/cute-charm","abilityDetails":"30% chance of infatuating Pokemon of the opposite gender if they make contact."},{"abilityName":"Magic Guard","abilityId":"/abilities/magic-guard","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon can only be damaged by direct attacks."},{"abilityName":"Unaware","abilityId":"/abilities/unaware","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon ignores other Pokemon's stat stages when taking or doing damage."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:36.5065074Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Magic Guard","abilityId":"/abilities/magic-guard","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon can only be damaged by direct attacks."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Calm","natureId":"/natures/calm","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":200},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":56},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Moonblast","moveId":"/moves/moonblast","moveType":{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":95,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"30% chance to lower the target's Sp.
