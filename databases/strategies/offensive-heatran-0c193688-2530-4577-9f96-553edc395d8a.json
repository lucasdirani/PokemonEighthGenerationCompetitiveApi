{"strategyName":"Offensive","strategyId":"/strategies/offensive?pokemon=heatran&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>This set acts as an offensive wallbreaker that can pressure common defensive Pokemon by trapping them. Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>. Earth Power provides good coverage and hits Toxapex and opposing Heatran. Taunt allows Heatran to overwhelm <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, Toxapex, and Blissey. Toxic cripples common switch-ins such as Slowking, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>, which makes it difficult for them to check it later.</p>\n<p>Pivots such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> make good teammates, as they lure in and pivot on Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> and Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, which Heatran can threaten to KO and force out. These Pokemon also take care of bulky Water-types that Heatran can often struggle with. Other Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> are great partners as well, as they share common checks like Slowking and Tyranitar with Heatran, which can be overwhelmed trying to check both threats.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Heatran","pokemonId":"/pokemon/heatran","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Fire","typeId":"/types/fire"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":91},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":106},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":106},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":77}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Flame Body","abilityId":"/abilities/flame-body","abilityDetails":"30% chance a Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon will be burned."},{"abilityName":"Flash Fire","abilityId":"/abilities/flash-fire","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Fire attacks do 1.5x damage if hit by one Fire move; Fire immunity."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:39.6123129Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Flash Fire","abilityId":"/abilities/flash-fire","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Fire attacks do 1.5x damage if hit by one Fire move; Fire immunity."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}},{"natureName":"Modest","natureId":"/natures/modest","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Magma Storm","moveId":"/moves/magma-storm","moveType":{"typeName":"Fire","typeId":"/types/fire"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":75,"moveDetails":"Traps and damages the target for 4-5 turns."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Earth Power","moveId":"/moves/earth-power","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to lower the target's Sp.
