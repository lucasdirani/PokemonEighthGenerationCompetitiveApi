{"strategyName":"Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive?pokemon=celesteela&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Flamethrower hits Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, preventing them from reliably setting up on Celesteela, while also hitting Grass-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>, which are immune to Leech Seed. Leech Seed is important to wear down common switch-ins, including <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>. It also prevents Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a> and Dragon Dance <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> from reliably setting up on Celesteela, chipping them down. Protect works well alongside Leech Seed, offering Celesteela a guaranteed opportunity to restore health with both Leftovers and Leech Seed. It can also help to scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zygarde-10\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde-10%</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>.</p>\n<p>Celesteela is a solid fit on bulky offense and balance teams thanks to its ability to check several prominent threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a> and Zarude, allowing offensive teammates to fall back on it upon losing momentum to foes like Salamence. Bulky Water-types often share strong synergy with Celesteela, checking the Fire-types that power through it, while Celesteela can handle Pokemon like Zarude and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a> in return. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> check both <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> and Moltres, two of Celesteela's more effective answers, while also being helpful against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a>. Slowking can also bring Celesteela in safely with Teleport against foes such as Tapu Bulu and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> is another good teammate, pivoting in on Pokemon like Moltres and Thundurus-T for Celesteela while appreciating its ability to deal with Ground-types such as Excadrill and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>. Defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> can also make solid teammates, as they can pivot into threats to Celesteela like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>. They both can absorb Knock Off for Celesteela, and the former can use Knock Off itself to cripple switch-ins to Celesteela like Moltres. Zarude is another phenomonal partner capable of offensively pressuring Slowking better and revenge killing Thundurus-T. Entry hazard removal from the likes of <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a> keep Celesteela from being worn down by Stealth Rock.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Celesteela","pokemonId":"/pokemon/celesteela","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":97},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":101},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":103},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":107},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":101},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":61}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Beast Boost","abilityId":"/abilities/beast-boost","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's highest stat is raised by 1 if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:24.7232987Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Beast Boost","abilityId":"/abilities/beast-boost","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's highest stat is raised by 1 if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Sassy","natureId":"/natures/sassy","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Heavy Slam","moveId":"/moves/heavy-slam","moveType":{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"More power the heavier the user than the target."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Flamethrower","moveId":"/moves/flamethrower","moveType":{"typeName":"Fire","typeId":"/types/fire"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to burn the target."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Leech Seed","moveId":"/moves/leech-seed","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"1/8 of target's HP is restored to user every turn."}],"strategyFourthMoves":[{"moveName":"Protect","moveId":"/moves/protect","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Prevents moves from affecting the user this turn."}]}}
