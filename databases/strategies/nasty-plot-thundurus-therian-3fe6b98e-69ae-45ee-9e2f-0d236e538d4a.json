{"strategyName":"Nasty Plot","strategyId":"/strategies/nasty-plot?pokemon=thundurus-therian&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Nasty Plot boosts Thundurus-T's attack to sky high levels, letting it OHKO Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> as well as 2HKO <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>. Psychic hits Amoonguss, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a> for a lot of damage. Sludge Wave is an option that deals with <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> better. Focus Blast nails Chansey, Rhyperior, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>. Heavy-Duty Boots helps <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus</a> come in to pick off threats without having to worry about Stealth Rock, staying out of range of priority moves from Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>, thus giving it ample opportunities to wallbreak.</p>\n<p>Thundurus-T fits best on hyper offense teams due to its amazing Special Attack and useful Speed, allowing it to wallbreak and sweep after only one boost. Spikes support from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/klefki\" hreflang=\"en\">Klefki</a> helps Thundurus-T be less reliant on Nasty Plot, as it risks being KOed while setting up or be forced to predict switches. Sticky Web support from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ribombee\" hreflang=\"en\">Ribombee</a> fixes Thundurus-T's mediocre Speed to let it outspeed threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a>, Nihilego, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a>. Late-game cleaners like Dragon Dance Salamence, Lycanroc-D, and Nasty Plot <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a> appreciate the early-game wallbreaking Thundurus-T does, allowing them to finish off weakened teams. Wallbreakers like Azumarill and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a> can remove Pokemon like Tangrowth and Chansey for Thundurus-T. They can also help check and remove Lycanroc-D.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Thundurus-Therian","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/thundurus-therian","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":79},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":145},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":101}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Volt Absorb","abilityId":"/abilities/volt-absorb","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon heals 1/4 of its max HP when hit by Electric moves; Electric immunity."}],"pokemonFormTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:35.440843Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Volt Absorb","abilityId":"/abilities/volt-absorb","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon heals 1/4 of its max HP when hit by Electric moves; Electric immunity."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Nasty Plot","moveId":"/moves/nasty-plot","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Sp.
