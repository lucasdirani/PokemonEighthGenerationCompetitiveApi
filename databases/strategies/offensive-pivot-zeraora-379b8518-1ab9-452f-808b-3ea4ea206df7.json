  "strategyDetails": "Knock Off allows Zeraora to cripple the likes of Landorus-T, Garchomp, Swampert, and Ferrothorn by removing their much needed item, especially Leftovers, making it easier for them to be worn down due to their lack of reliable recovery. Close Combat hits Pokemon that resist all of its other moves such as Hydreigon, Kartana, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Toxic allows Zeraora to wear down Pokemon such as the aforementioned Landorus-T and Garchomp as well as Tangrowth that can reliably switch into its STAB move. However, Toxic can be replaced with Volt Switch, which gives Zeraora the option to pivot out from an unfavorable matchup versus Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth. Zeraora commonly fits best on offensive and balance teams, as its consistency with providing offensive momentum while also being able to revenge kill and clean late-game thanks to its amazing Speed and primary STAB move makes it fit onto these teams well. Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Scizor are great teammates, as they form a potent VoltTurn core with it; the former two in particular are able to wear down Ground-types that Zeraora struggles with with Hurricane and Toxic, respectively. On the other hand, Zeraora can pivot against Grass-types to bring in Tornadus-T and Scizor and provide an Electric immunity for Tornadus-T. Pokemon that can cover Zeraora's disadvantageous matchup versus Ground-types such as Slowbro, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn while providing utility in Future Sight, slow pivoting, and Spikes respectively make for great teammates. Zeraora's ability to consistently take advantage of Pokemon such as Corviknight, Slowking, and Toxapex due to their fear of being OHKOed by its STAB move makes it a great partner for Pokemon like Rillaboom, Nidoking, and Tornadus-T that generally struggle with these foes. Pokemon that appreciate Zeraora's ability to provide offensive momentum against Grass-types via Volt Switch such as Kyurem and Tapu Lele are very useful teammates, as they can heavily threaten them out. Future Sight support from Slowking and Slowbro is very beneficial, as Ground-types will be more pressured and easily worn down.",
