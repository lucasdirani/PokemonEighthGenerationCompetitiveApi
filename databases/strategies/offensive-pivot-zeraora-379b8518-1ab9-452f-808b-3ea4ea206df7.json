{"strategyName":"Offensive Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/offensive-pivot?pokemon=zeraora&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Knock Off allows Zeraora to cripple the likes of <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> by removing their much needed item, especially Leftovers, making it easier for them to be worn down due to their lack of reliable recovery. Close Combat hits Pokemon that resist all of its other moves such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Toxic allows Zeraora to wear down Pokemon such as the aforementioned Landorus-T and Garchomp as well as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> that can reliably switch into its STAB move. However, Toxic can be replaced with Volt Switch, which gives Zeraora the option to pivot out from an unfavorable matchup versus Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth.</p>\n<p>Zeraora commonly fits best on offensive and balance teams, as its consistency with providing offensive momentum while also being able to revenge kill and clean late-game thanks to its amazing Speed and primary STAB move makes it fit onto these teams well. Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, Landorus-T, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a> are great teammates, as they form a potent VoltTurn core with it; the former two in particular are able to wear down Ground-types that Zeraora struggles with with Hurricane and Toxic, respectively. On the other hand, Zeraora can pivot against Grass-types to bring in Tornadus-T and Scizor and provide an Electric immunity for Tornadus-T. Pokemon that can cover Zeraora's disadvantageous matchup versus Ground-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>, and Ferrothorn while providing utility in Future Sight, slow pivoting, and Spikes respectively make for great teammates. Zeraora's ability to consistently take advantage of Pokemon such as Corviknight, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> due to their fear of being OHKOed by its STAB move makes it a great partner for Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, and Tornadus-T that generally struggle with these foes. Pokemon that appreciate Zeraora's ability to provide offensive momentum against Grass-types via Volt Switch such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a> are very useful teammates, as they can heavily threaten them out. Future Sight support from Slowking and Slowbro is very beneficial, as Ground-types will be more pressured and easily worn down.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Zeraora","pokemonId":"/pokemon/zeraora","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":88},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":112},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":102},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":143}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Volt Absorb","abilityId":"/abilities/volt-absorb","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon heals 1/4 of its max HP when hit by Electric moves; Electric immunity."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:50.5684496Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Volt Absorb","abilityId":"/abilities/volt-absorb","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon heals 1/4 of its max HP when hit by Electric moves; Electric immunity."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Plasma Fists","moveId":"/moves/plasma-fists","moveType":{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Normal moves become Electric type this turn."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Knock Off","moveId":"/moves/knock-off","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":65,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"1.5x damage if foe holds an item.
