  "strategyDetails": "Nasty Plot grants Hydreigon absurd wallbreaking capabilities, allowing it to fully overwhelm Pokemon such as Scizor and Corviknight. Dark Pulse is the primary attack thanks to its decent coverage and power, hitting Pokemon such as Corviknight, Zapdos, and Landorus-T. Earth Power is a coverage option that immediately threatens Heatran and lets Hydreigon break through Tyranitar after a Nasty Plot boost, although Flash Cannon can potentially OHKO Clefable after a Nasty Plot boost and still hit Tyranitar super effectively. Roost is crucial to help Hydreigon better function as a stallbreaker as well as pivot into Heatran, Toxapex, and Slowbro consistently. Life Orb gives Hydreigon a noticeable boost to its power, allowing it to OHKO Corviknight and Clefable with one boost. However, Leftovers is a viable choice to improve its longevity, as Hydreigon still has decent power after a boost and may appreciate pivoting better and possibly setting up on the aforementioned Heatran and Slowbro. Hydreigon can opt for a Modest nature for more power, hitting benchmarks such as a guaranteed OHKO on Clefable with +2 Flash Cannon, although it loses out on the ability to outpace many notable Pokemon such as Kyurem. Draco Meteor is an option over Earth Power or Flash Cannon, as it has absurd power after a Nasty Plot boost, although its Special Attack drops and lack of coverage hinder it as an option. Focus Blast and Flamethrower are also viable options in that third moveslot to better pressure Ferrothorn as well as either Tyranitar and Blissey or Corviknight, respectively, although they have little use outside of this. Pivots such as Landorus-T and Slowking can lure in Corviknight and Ferrothorn, respectively, to pivot out and bring Hydreigon in. Depending on whether Hydreigon forgoes Earth Power or Flash Cannon, it will be fully checked by either Tapu Koko or Clefable; this makes Galarian Slowking a decent teammate, as it can stomach attacks from these Pokemon. Galarian Slowking can also use Future Sight to punish Steel-type switch-ins such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Ironically, Corviknight and Skarmory make for decent teammates, as they can check Garchomp and Kartana; Corviknight, once again, can lure in Pokemon such as Zapdos and bring in Hydreigon with U-turn, while Skarmory can provide Spikes to wear down Hydreigon's checks such as Tapu Fini. Cleaners such as Rillaboom and Weavile appreciate Hydreigon pressuring and softening up common defensive cores such as Corviknight + Slowking early-game.",
