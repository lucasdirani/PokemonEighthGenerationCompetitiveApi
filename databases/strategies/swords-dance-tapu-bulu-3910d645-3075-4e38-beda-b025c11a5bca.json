{"strategyName":"Swords Dance","strategyId":"/strategies/swords-dance?pokemon=tapu-bulu&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Horn Leech is the preferred STAB option thanks to its recovery and respectable damage. Stone Edge is crucial coverage to break past Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chandelure\" hreflang=\"en\">Chandelure</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>. Close Combat lets Tapu Bulu break through <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/cobalion\" hreflang=\"en\">Cobalion</a> and hit other Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> harder; however, dropping Stone Edge leaves it unable to punish the common Flying-types, particularly Moltres, which can fish for a burn with Flame Body. Zen Headbutt breaks through <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a>. Megahorn can help against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>; however, its coverage isn't very useful otherwise. Darkest Lariat can be used to hit Pokemon like Jirachi, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>, and Chandelure harder. Life Orb with an Adamant nature gives +2 Tapu Bulu the extra power needed to KO foes like Tangrowth and Celesteela. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Buzzwole and Timid <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcanion\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcanion</a>, though Adamant's power is generally valued more.</p>\n<p>Tapu Bulu fits best on offense and balance teams that appreciate its combination of utility and wallbreaking potential. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> can lure in foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/seismitoad\" hreflang=\"en\">Seismitoad</a>, giving Tapu Bulu free opportunities to use Swords Dance. Rotom-W can also remove foes like Moltres and wear down Kommo-o and Amoonguss into KO range of Tapu Bulu's attacks. Other wallbreakers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> can help break through defensive cores that Tapu Bulu struggles with. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> appreciates Tapu Bulu being able to lure in and remove bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a> is appreciated as another Water-resistant Pokemon, as Tapu Bulu doesn't want to risk a burn from Keldeo's Scald, for example. Although Tapu Bulu is a Fairy-type, it struggles to consistently check a majority of Dragon-types, such as Salamence and Kommo-o, due to its lack of a good Fairy-type attack and its weakness to their common coverage. For this reason, partners like Celesteela and Aegislash are imperative.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Tapu Bulu","pokemonId":"/pokemon/tapu-bulu","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":115},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":75}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Telepathy","abilityId":"/abilities/telepathy","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon does not take damage from attacks made by its allies."},{"abilityName":"Grassy Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/grassy-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Grassy Terrain."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:34.7705632Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Grassy Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/grassy-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Grassy Terrain."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Adamant","natureId":"/natures/adamant","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"}},{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Swords Dance","moveId":"/moves/swords-dance","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Attack by 2."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Horn Leech","moveId":"/moves/horn-leech","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":75,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User recovers 50% of the damage dealt."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Stone Edge","moveId":"/moves/stone-edge","moveType":{"typeName":"Rock","typeId":"/types/rock"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":80,"moveDetails":"High critical hit ratio."}],"strategyFourthMoves":[{"moveName":"Zen Headbutt","moveId":"/moves/zen-headbutt","moveType":{"typeName":"Psychic","typeId":"/types/psychic"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"20% chance to make the target flinch."}]}}
