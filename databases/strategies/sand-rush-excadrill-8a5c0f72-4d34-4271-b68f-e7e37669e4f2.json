{"strategyName":"Sand Rush","strategyId":"/strategies/sand-rush?pokemon=excadrill&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>If your team has other reliable forms of entry hazard removal, Rock Slide can be used over Rapid Spin to provide coverage for some Pokemon that resist Excadrill's STAB moves, such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>. Swords Dance allows Excadrill to take advantage of forced switches and Pokemon it walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to cripple walls that can otherwise switch into Excadrill with ease, such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>. A Jolly nature is used to allow Excadrill to outspeed Timid <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, Timid <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>, and Modest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> outside of sand. Leftovers makes Excadrill harder to wear down so it can find more opportunities to sweep.</p>\n<p>Sand Rush Excadrill fits exclusively with either <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a> or <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a> to set sand. Specially defensive Tyranitar in particular can set Stealth Rock for it and check threats to it such as Zapdos. Hippowdon is an alternative sand setter that can switch into opposing Excadrill and also set Stealth Rock. It has better longevity due to its reliable recovery but is more passive than Tyranitar. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dracozolt\" hreflang=\"en\">Dracozolt</a> can be added to this sand core to break through walls Excadrill struggles against like Mandibuzz, Slowbro, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>. If Excadrill is running Toxic, it can lure in and cripple some of Dracozolt's checks like Hippowdon and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, making it easier for Dracozolt to beat them. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> can lure in and weaken Zapdos and Corviknight with Stone Edge and Fire Fang, respectively, to ease Excadrill's sweep, and it can wear down Water- and Grass-types like Slowbro and Tangrowth that check Excadrill. Mandibuzz, Corviknight, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> are consistent checks to <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, which sand cores typically struggle against, as well as Ground-types like Garchomp and opposing Excadrill. The former two can also remove entry hazards, allowing Excadrill to run Rock Slide over Rapid Spin more freely, while Skarmory is of particular note, as it is able to set Spikes, which is particularly effective at chipping Excadrill's checks down into its KO range.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Excadrill","pokemonId":"/pokemon/excadrill","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":135},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":88}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Mold Breaker","abilityId":"/abilities/mold-breaker","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves and their effects ignore the Abilities of other Pokemon."},{"abilityName":"Sand Force","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-force","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Ground/Rock/Steel attacks do 1.3x in Sandstorm; immunity to it."},{"abilityName":"Sand Rush","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-rush","abilityDetails":"If Sandstorm is active, this Pokemon's Speed is doubled; immunity to Sandstorm."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:38.2334839Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sand Rush","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-rush","abilityDetails":"If Sandstorm is active, this Pokemon's Speed is doubled; immunity to Sandstorm."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Swords Dance","moveId":"/moves/swords-dance","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Attack by 2."},{"moveName":"Toxic","moveId":"/moves/toxic","moveType":{"typeName":"Poison","typeId":"/types/poison"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Badly poisons the target.
