{"strategyName":"Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/pivot?pokemon=rotom-heat&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Overheat and Volt Switch have good synergy, letting Rotom-H hit hard and then pivot. Toxic cripples most defensive answers to Rotom-H, such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gastrodon\" hreflang=\"en\">Gastrodon</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/seismitoad\" hreflang=\"en\">Seismitoad</a>. Defog can be used against Pokemon Rotom-H forces out like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>. Pain Split serves as Rotom-H's only recovery tool, taking advantage of checks that can consistently recover their HP such as Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/reuniclus\" hreflang=\"en\">Reuniclus</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Rotom-H get onto the field safely and more frequently. Maximum Speed Evs are used to outspeed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> and nail it with a powerful Overheat.</p>\n<p>Rotom-H fits on bulky offense and balance teams, which appreciate its ability to pivot and form a VoltTurn core with Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>, remove entry hazards for teammates, and break through walls like Amoonguss. Amoonguss and Zarude make for great partners, destroying Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types like Gastrodon, Rhyperior, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>. In return, Rotom-H takes care of Steel- and Flying-types like Celesteela and Moltres. Krookodile is another exceptional teammate, as Rotom-H brings it in safely against foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> and Assault Vest Reuniclus. Rotom-H also pressures Celesteela for Krookodile, and together they deal with <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> for teammates like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> and Nihilego. Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi cover Rotom-H's weakness to Rock-types like Nihilego and Lycanroc-D. Rotom-H can remove Steel-types like Celesteela and other checks like Amoonguss and Moltres for them. Wallbreakers that are frail or slow, like Lycanroc-D and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>, appreciate Rotom-H bringing them in safely against Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> are secondary Ground-type answers that ease the pressure on Rotom-H to deal with Pokemon like Rhyperior and Seismitoad, as, despite Levitate, it can't deal well with them.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Rotom-Heat","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/rotom-heat","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},{"typeName":"Fire","typeId":"/types/fire"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":107},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":107},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":86}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"pokemonFormTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:33.0202562Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Overheat","moveId":"/moves/overheat","moveType":{"typeName":"Fire","typeId":"/types/fire"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":130,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Lowers the user's Sp.
