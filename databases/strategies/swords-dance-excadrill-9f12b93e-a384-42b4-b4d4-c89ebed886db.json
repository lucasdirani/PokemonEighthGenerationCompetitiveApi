{"strategyName":"Swords Dance","strategyId":"/strategies/swords-dance?pokemon=excadrill&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Swords Dance boosts Excadrill's Attack to sky-high levels, letting it overwhelm the sturdiest of physical walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> with its STAB moves if Stealth Rock is up. In conjunction with Mold Breaker, it can break through <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/quagsire\" hreflang=\"en\">Quagsire</a>'s Unaware. Rapid Spin lets Excadrill compress entry hazard removal alongside boosting its Speed, making it a dangerous late-game threat, as faster threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zygarde-10\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde-10%</a> can no longer revenge kill it. Rock Slide is an option to slam <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>, which otherwise counters this set, and hit <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, but it only should be used if the team can fit entry hazard removal elsewhere. Leftovers makes Excadrill harder to wear down, further facilitating its sweeping attempts.</p>\n<p>Excadrill best fits on offensive teams that give it ample opportunities to wallbreak. Pivot support from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>, Thundurus-T, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> can bring Excadrill in safely to set up against their checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/togekiss\" hreflang=\"en\">Togekiss</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>. Notably, Slowking is a slow pivot, providing Excadrill with a free switch with Teleport. Slowking and Thundurus-T are also great at taking advantage of Celesteela and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, both of which wall Excadrill. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can provide a key defensive backbone for Excadrill, taking on threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>. Entry hazard support from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a> is key in helping Excadrill break through physical walls like Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Early-game wallbreakers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a> and Conkeldurr can weaken walls like Celesteela and Moltres for it to cleanly sweep late-game. Other Steel-types like Celesteela and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> can make up for Excadrill's frailty by checking threats it normally would like Aegislash and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a>.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Excadrill","pokemonId":"/pokemon/excadrill","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":135},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":88}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Mold Breaker","abilityId":"/abilities/mold-breaker","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves and their effects ignore the Abilities of other Pokemon."},{"abilityName":"Sand Force","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-force","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Ground/Rock/Steel attacks do 1.3x in Sandstorm; immunity to it."},{"abilityName":"Sand Rush","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-rush","abilityDetails":"If Sandstorm is active, this Pokemon's Speed is doubled; immunity to Sandstorm."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:38.2284922Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Mold Breaker","abilityId":"/abilities/mold-breaker","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves and their effects ignore the Abilities of other Pokemon."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Earthquake","moveId":"/moves/earthquake","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Hits adjacent Pokemon.
