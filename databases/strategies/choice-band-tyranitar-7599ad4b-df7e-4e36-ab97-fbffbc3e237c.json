{"strategyName":"Choice Band","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-band?pokemon=tyranitar&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Tyranitar's high Attack stat further supported with Choice Band and solid coverage options makes it a great wallbreaker. Additionally, its fantastic special bulk under sand gives it defensive utility and allows it to check certain Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a>. Fire Punch allows Tyranitar to hit Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a>, threatening them with an OHKO, while also providing another option to 2HKO <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> if Stone Edge PPs or its accuracy is a concern. Ice Punch nails <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> on the switch while hitting <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a> for decent damage. Heavy Slam can be used to OHKO <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>.</p>\n<p>Choice Band Tyranitar pairs well with pivots like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, and Corviknight that can give it free switches to attack. Slowbro checks Ground- and Water-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>, while Slowking can check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a> and Clefable. Both of them offer Teleport to bring in Tyranitar safely and also provide Future Sight support, which makes Tyranitar far harder to switch into. Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Corviknight can deal with Grass- and Ground-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, Kartana, and Landorus-T, and they can bring Tyranitar in safely with U-turn against their own checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> and Heatran. Bulk Up Corviknight is a great teammate, as it appreciates Tyranitar's ability to deal with its checks such as Zapdos, Heatran, and Volcarona for a late-game sweep. Sand sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dracozolt\" hreflang=\"en\">Dracozolt</a>, and Sand Veil Garchomp enjoy Tyranitar's sand and ability to weaken their checks such as Landorus-T and Corviknight, allowing them to clean late-game. Outside of sand teams, Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, Swords Dance Scizor, and Swords Dance Landorus-T benefit from Tyranitar weakening opposing Landorus-T and Corviknight, which gives them more opportunities to set up and break through opposing defensive cores or clean late-game.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Tyranitar","pokemonId":"/pokemon/tyranitar","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Rock","typeId":"/types/rock"},{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":134},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":61}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sand Stream","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-stream","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Sandstorm."},{"abilityName":"Unnerve","abilityId":"/abilities/unnerve","abilityDetails":"While this Pokemon is active, it prevents opposing Pokemon from using their Berries."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:49.1538787Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Band","itemId":"/items/choice-band","itemDetails":"Holder's Attack is 1.5x, but it can only select the first move it executes."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sand Stream","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-stream","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Sandstorm."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Adamant","natureId":"/natures/adamant","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Stone Edge","moveId":"/moves/stone-edge","moveType":{"typeName":"Rock","typeId":"/types/rock"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":80,"moveDetails":"High critical hit ratio."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Crunch","moveId":"/moves/crunch","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"20% chance to lower the target's Defense by 1."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Fire Punch","moveId":"/moves/fire-punch","moveType":{"typeName":"Fire","typeId":"/types/fire"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":75,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to burn the target."}],"strategyFourthMoves":[{"moveName":"Ice Punch","moveId":"/moves/ice-punch","moveType":{"typeName":"Ice","typeId":"/types/ice"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":75,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to freeze the target."},{"moveName":"Heavy Slam","moveId":"/moves/heavy-slam","moveType":{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"More power the heavier the user than the target."}]}}
