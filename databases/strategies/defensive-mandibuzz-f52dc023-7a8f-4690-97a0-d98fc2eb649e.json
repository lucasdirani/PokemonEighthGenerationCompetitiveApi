{"strategyName":"Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive?pokemon=mandibuzz&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Mandibuzz operates best as a mixed defensive Pokemon to check a plethora of threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>. Foul Play enables it to threaten Swords Dance users like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>, Rillaboom, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, and Kartana while also discouraging them from setting up. Roost gives it longevity to better check threats like Dragapult and Choice Band Rillaboom, which would easily overwhelm Mandibuzz otherwise. U-turn lets it keep up momentum and pivot out on its checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> to safely bring in its teammates. Knock Off can be a good choice instead to immediately punish its switch-ins. The EVs are used to survive two Draco Meteors from Choice Specs Dragapult and two Smart Strikes from Choice Band Kartana. The remaining EVs are put into Speed to outspeed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> makes a good partner, since it can help alleviate pressure by covering physical threats like Excadrill and Garchomp that Mandibuzz can struggle with. Mandibuzz can also do the same for Landorus-T by checking offensive Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom. Similarly, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> can handle special threats that Mandibuzz can struggle with, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>. Mandibuzz also offers Slowking a switch-in to Ghost-type moves from threats like Dragapult. Mandibuzz's ability to lure in Tapu Koko and Kyurem and pivot on them can let Dragapult threaten a KO on them, and Dragapult also likes it switching into opposing Dragapult. Wallbreakers like Kyurem and Nidoking that have a difficult time switching in can take advantage of Mandibuzz's slow pivoting.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Mandibuzz","pokemonId":"/pokemon/mandibuzz","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":55},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":80}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Overcoat","abilityId":"/abilities/overcoat","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to powder moves and damage from Sandstorm or Hail."},{"abilityName":"Weak Armor","abilityId":"/abilities/weak-armor","abilityDetails":"If a physical attack hits this Pokemon, Defense is lowered by 1, Speed is raised by 2."},{"abilityName":"Big Pecks","abilityId":"/abilities/big-pecks","abilityDetails":"Prevents other Pokemon from lowering this Pokemon's Defense stat stage."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:42.1738546Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Overcoat","abilityId":"/abilities/overcoat","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to powder moves and damage from Sandstorm or Hail."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Impish","natureId":"/natures/impish","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":248},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":92},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":152},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":16}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Foul Play","moveId":"/moves/foul-play","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":95,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Uses target's Attack stat in damage calculation."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Roost","moveId":"/moves/roost","moveType":{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Heals 50% HP.
