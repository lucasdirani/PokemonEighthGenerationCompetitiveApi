{"strategyName":"Wallbreaker","strategyId":"/strategies/wallbreaker?pokemon=nidoking&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Sludge Wave is Nidoking's strongest STAB move, hitting Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> super effectively, as well as discouraging <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> from switching in freely. Earth Power slams Steel- and Poison-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>. Thunderbolt allows Nidoking to nail Water- and Flying-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>. Ice Beam can be used to OHKO opposing Ground-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>, as well as OHKOing <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/noivern\" hreflang=\"en\">Noivern</a>, while Substitute makes Nidoking much less prediction reliant, giving it free turns against foes that it forces out like Nihilego, Tangrowth, and Aegislash. Stealth Rock can be run for role compression thanks to Nidoking preventing common entry hazard removers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a> from switching into it. A Modest nature should be run to increase Nidoking's damage output against threats like Slowking and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>, since it doesn't miss out on any notable Speed benchmarks. Life Orb and Sheer Force pair together to negate the health loss of Life Orb while giving an effective 70% power boost, which is a big factor behind Nidoking's power.</p>\n<p>Nidoking fits best on offensive teams that are able to bring it in many times to wallbreak and tear through defensive Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> and Aegislash. As a result, pivots such as Rotom-W, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a> make for good partners. Mienshao comfortably beats <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>, Zarude forces out <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>, and Rotom-W lures in Tangrowth for Nidoking and OHKOes Krookodile. Chansey is also a great partner for Nidoking, providing pivot support while beating its common checks like Rotom-W and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>. Switch-ins to Psychic-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks like Jirachi, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss can be paired with Nidoking on bulkier teams. Jirachi also provides entry hazard support, allowing Nidoking to reliably KO Celesteela, and Healing Wish support to let it wallbreak even more. Tangrowth and Amoonguss are also able to handle Electric-types in the tier much better than Nidoking and can pivot into the likes of <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> excellently. Late-game cleaners like the aforementioned Mienshao and Lycanroc-D are great to break through Chansey, which Nidoking struggles against. Sticky Web support from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ribombee\" hreflang=\"en\">Ribombee</a> offsets Nidoking's average Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO threats like Tentacruel, Excadrill, and Lycanroc-D.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Nidoking","pokemonId":"/pokemon/nidoking","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Poison","typeId":"/types/poison"},{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":81},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":102},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":77},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":85}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Poison Point","abilityId":"/abilities/poison-point","abilityDetails":"30% chance a Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon will be poisoned."},{"abilityName":"Rivalry","abilityId":"/abilities/rivalry","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's attacks do 1.25x on same gender targets; 0.75x on opposite gender."},{"abilityName":"Sheer Force","abilityId":"/abilities/sheer-force","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's attacks with secondary effects have 1.3x power; nullifies the effects."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:42.9444829Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sheer Force","abilityId":"/abilities/sheer-force","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's attacks with secondary effects have 1.3x power; nullifies the effects."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Modest","natureId":"/natures/modest","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Sludge Wave","moveId":"/moves/sludge-wave","moveType":{"typeName":"Poison","typeId":"/types/poison"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":95,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to poison adjacent Pokemon."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Earth Power","moveId":"/moves/earth-power","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to lower the target's Sp.
