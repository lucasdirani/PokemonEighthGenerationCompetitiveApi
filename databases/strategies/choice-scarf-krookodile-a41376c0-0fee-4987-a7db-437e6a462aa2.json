{"strategyName":"Choice Scarf","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-scarf?pokemon=krookodile&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Knock Off pressures walls that rely on their items, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>, and discourages Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> from switching in. Stone Edge threatens Pokemon immune to Ground like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>, and Rotom-H. Close Combat lets Krookodile hit targets such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, Chansey, and opposing Krookodile harder. Toxic cripples switch-ins such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, but since others like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> and Zarude are immune or resilient to it, it's quite matchup reliant. Darkest Lariat is useful to hit Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> harder after they've had their items removed. Stealth Rock can be used to take advantage of Krookodile's ability to force switches against Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>, but it should only be used when the role compression is necessary, and it requires very good prediction. Choice Scarf turns Krookodile into a solid revenge killer, outspeeding key Pokemon and sweepers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a>, Azelf, and +1 Gyarados.</p>\n<p>This set fits well on offense, bulky offense, and balance teams that need a fast revenge killer. These kinds of teams appreciate Krookodile's defensive utility in its two immunities and Intimidate. Even though Intimidate allows Krookodile to take on physical attacks a bit better, it shouldn't be relied on, so teammates like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and Tangrowth help it against wallbreakers like Lycanroc-D. Assault Vest Tangrowth takes on threatening Water-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>, Rotom-W, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> well. Strong wallbreakers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> can get past Krookodile's checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, and Tapu Bulu, allowing it to spam its STAB moves more freely. Krookodile is helpless against Grass-types, so partners that can pressure them like Nihilego and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a> are great. Rotom-H is another good teammate that can scare away Grass-types and brings Krookodile in on checks like Nihilego. Entry hazard support from teammates such as Nihilego and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> is key to weaken checks like Rotom-W and Primarina. Salamence and Moltres ensure Tapu Bulu is not given free turns to wallbreak, as it can freely come into Krookodile.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Krookodile","pokemonId":"/pokemon/krookodile","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":117},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":92}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."},{"abilityName":"Anger Point","abilityId":"/abilities/anger-point","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon (not its substitute) takes a critical hit, its Attack is raised 12 stages."},{"abilityName":"Moxie","abilityId":"/abilities/moxie","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Attack is raised by 1 stage if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:28.8132599Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Scarf","itemId":"/items/choice-scarf","itemDetails":"Holder's Speed is 1.5x, but it can only select the first move it executes."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Earthquake","moveId":"/moves/earthquake","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Hits adjacent Pokemon.
