{"strategyName":"Defensive Spikes","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive-spikes?pokemon=skarmory&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Body Press is the preferred attacking move, as it deals significant damage to most of the physical attackers Skarmory wants to check like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, and it punishes <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a> attempting to switch in and trap Skarmory. Iron Defense allows Skarmory to match boosts from setup sweepers like Swords Dance <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>. Be careful when facing Kartana, however, as Sacred Sword bypasses Defense boosts. Iron Defense also boosts the power of Body Press, making Skarmory less passive and potentially able to sweep late-game if faster special attackers are removed. Toxic is an alternative to cripple some Pokemon that can otherwise switch into Skarmory like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, and it allows Skarmory to more consistently keep its Spikes up; it quickly puts most Defog users, with the exception of <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>, on a timer. However, it lets physical setup attackers overwhelm Skarmory in the short term. Rocky Helmet allows Skarmory to wear down physical attackers that make contact like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a> and Weavile. It is also particularly useful for deterring U-turn to gain momentum from the likes of Rillaboom, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, and Urshifu-R, forcing progress against them. At the cost of considerable bulk, 176 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Modest Magnezone so that Skarmory can 2HKO it with Body Press if it is weakened or caught on the switch.</p>\n<p>Many offensive Pokemon can benefit from Skarmory's Spikes punishing the switches they force and wearing down checks, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/bisharp\" hreflang=\"en\">Bisharp</a>, Weavile, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>. Bisharp and Weavile are particularly notable for their powerful Knock Offs, which can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes to wear them down further with Spikes, and the former can deter Defog thanks to Defiant while utilizing Assurance to take advantage of Spikes. Ground-types like Landorus-T, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a>, and Garchomp can check Electric-types for Skarmory. Skarmory usually draws in special attackers, making special walls that can check them for it ideal teammates. For example, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a> is a good check to Dragapult and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, Slowking checks <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, and Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a> covers <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> and Tapu Koko. Skarmory's Spikes prevents U-turn users like Dragapult and Tapu Koko from freely using them for momentum, especially when paired with Knock Off support. Skarmory can also check most of the strong physical attackers that can beat them, like Rillaboom and Landorus-T. Skarmory is especially valuable to sand teams, as it can check Pokemon that they are usually weak to like Rillaboom and Excadrill, forming a solid defensive core with either specially defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a> or Hippowdon, the two viable sand setters.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Skarmory","pokemonId":"/pokemon/skarmory","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":140},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":40},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":70}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sturdy","abilityId":"/abilities/sturdy","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon is at full HP, it survives one hit with at least 1 HP.
