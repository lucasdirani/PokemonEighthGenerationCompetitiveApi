{"strategyName":"Substitute + Calm Mind","strategyId":"/strategies/substitute-+-calm-mind?pokemon=primarina&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Substitute lets Primarina avoid sleep and poison, which would otherwise cripple it and prevent it from sweeping with Calm Mind. Common checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> can't deal with Primarina if it uses Substitute as they come in, as Primarina is faster and can set up with Calm Mind. Substitute also eases prediction when forcing switches from Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a>. Draining Kiss aids Primarina in recovering HP, allowing it to take more hits and use Substitute if needed. However, Draining Kiss is a very weak move and will only pose a threat if Primarina has accumulated enough boosts. Moonblast, on the other hand, is powerful from the start and lets Primarina not rely too much on Calm Mind boosts to threaten Water-resistant Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>. Scald is a reliable Water-type move, capable of burning Pokemon trying to check it, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a>, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Leftovers compensates the 25% loss in HP from Substitute. With the given EV spread Primarina is able to beat Amoonguss one-on-one, as it ensures Amoonguss can't break Primarina's Substitute after a Calm Mind.</p>\n<p>Substitute + Calm Mind Primarina fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, as its ability to come in on moves like Draco Meteor from Salamence is greatly appreciated by other teammates. By switching on these moves, Primarina can either get a Substitute up or set up with Calm Mind if its checks have been eliminated or weakened. Strong wallbreakers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> can get past bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Electric-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/raikou\" hreflang=\"en\">Raikou</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> force Primarina out of the field if it doesn't have a Substitute up, so Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/seismitoad\" hreflang=\"en\">Seismitoad</a> take care of them. They can also set Stealth Rock to aid Primarina in its sweep. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can take on strong physical attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diggersby\" hreflang=\"en\">Diggersby</a> and Mamoswine for Primarina. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> is extremely annoying, as it can take boosted hits with ease and threaten Primarina back with Toxic and Seismic Toss. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a>, and Swords Dance Diggersby are powerful wallbreakers that can muscle through Chansey and remove it for Primarina.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Primarina","pokemonId":"/pokemon/primarina","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":74},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":74},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":126},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":116},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":60}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Torrent","abilityId":"/abilities/torrent","abilityDetails":"At 1/3 or less of its max HP, this Pokemon's attacking stat is 1.5x with Water attacks."},{"abilityName":"Liquid Voice","abilityId":"/abilities/liquid-voice","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's sound-based moves become Water type."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:32.2995992Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Torrent","abilityId":"/abilities/torrent","abilityDetails":"At 1/3 or less of its max HP, this Pokemon's attacking stat is 1.5x with Water attacks."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Calm","natureId":"/natures/calm","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Calm Mind","moveId":"/moves/calm-mind","moveType":{"typeName":"Psychic","typeId":"/types/psychic"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Sp.
