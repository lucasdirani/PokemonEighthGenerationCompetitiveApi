{"strategyName":"Offensive Rain Sweeper","strategyId":"/strategies/offensive-rain-sweeper?pokemon=zapdos&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Zapdos's STAB Thunder and Hurricane become 100% accurate in rain, letting it spam them with no drawbacks and assume a wallbreaking role while providing needed defensive utility against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> that rain teams lack otherwise. Weather Ball makes it an even better user of rain, OHKOing both <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> that would otherwise be able to land a crippling Toxic or Knock Off. This unresisted coverage lets Zapdos become a potent offensive threat, especially against offensive teams lacking solid specially defensive walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>. Static greatly benefits its slower teammates like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>, as it can paralyze Pokemon like Kartana, making them much easier to deal with. A Timid nature is preferred, as it allows Zapdos to outspeed threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, Urshifu-R, and Swords Dance Landorus-T.</p>\n<p>Other Pokemon that can make use of rain, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/barraskewda\" hreflang=\"en\">Barraskewda</a> and Urshifu-R make good partners. They can pivot on their checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and Rillaboom to bring out Zapdos for a wallbreaking opportunity. In addition to setting rain and pivoting, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/pelipper\" hreflang=\"en\">Pelipper</a> can also use Defog to remove entry hazards, which can greatly benefit the team by freeing up a moveslot for Zapdos. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> is also a valuable teammate, since it can switch into opposing Electric-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> and provide Spikes support to help Zapdos and its teammates break through teams more easily. These two can also check offensive Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom together. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> makes a good partner for its Electric immunity and access to Stealth Rock, and in return Zapdos checks the offensive Grass-types it struggles with.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Zapdos","pokemonId":"/pokemon/zapdos","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":100}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Pressure","abilityId":"/abilities/pressure","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon is the target of a foe's move, that move loses one additional PP."},{"abilityName":"Static","abilityId":"/abilities/static","abilityDetails":"30% chance a Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon will be paralyzed."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:50.1802034Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Static","abilityId":"/abilities/static","abilityDetails":"30% chance a Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon will be paralyzed."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Thunder","moveId":"/moves/thunder","moveType":{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":110,"moveAccuracy":70,"moveDetails":"30% chance to paralyze.
