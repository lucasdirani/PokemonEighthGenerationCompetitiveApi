{"strategyName":"Defensive Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive-pivot?pokemon=rotom-wash&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Volt Switch is extremely useful on Rotom-W in order to grab momentum for wallbreaking teammates, especially when armed with Hydro Pump and several status conditions to threaten incoming Ground-types intending to block Volt Switch. Thunder Wave lets it cripple offensive Dragon-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a> more than a burn would while crippling walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>. Will-O-Wisp is also common to pressure <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, and it can provide amazing utility against Leftovers-reliant walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>. Both status moves can also deter and heavily punish switch-ins from offensive Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>. Pain Split and Leftovers let Rotom-W check offensive threats while pivoting through chip damage from entry hazards or status conditions for longer. 88 Speed EVs let it outspeed Adamant maximum Speed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a>. Rotom-W can use Defog because of its unique ability to relatively safely use Defog on Heatran, one of the most threatening Stealth Rock setters in the tier, as well as other extremely common Ground-type entry hazard setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, Garchomp, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a>. However, forgoing Pain Split recovery makes it a less consistent answer to most offensive threats. Defense investment is an option to take care of miscellaneous physical attackers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hawlucha\" hreflang=\"en\">Hawlucha</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a> more easily at the cost of reduced special bulk.</p>\n<p>Rotom-W fits best on bulky offense teams because it keeps up momentum consistently, enables its offensive teammates, and provides defensive flexibility. It gives opportunities to wallbreakers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/bisharp\" hreflang=\"en\">Bisharp</a>, Kartana, and Heatran after pivoting out on passive specially defensive walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>, Ferrothorn, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>. Other defensive pivots like Landorus-T and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> can help keep up momentum while respectively checking offensive Electric-types, like Tapu Koko and Zeraora, and Grass-types, like Rillaboom and Kartana, for Rotom-W. Scizor is also a fantastic partner because of its defensive synergy with Rotom-W. In addition to forming a potent momentum-based core, Scizor is a decent check to offensive Grass-type threats and can check strong wallbreakers, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, that would otherwise blow back Rotom-W. Rotom-W can help check opposing <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> and Heatran in return. Tapu Lele and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> enjoy Rotom-W's ability to check Heatran and force damage on Steel-types with Volt Switch or Will-O-Wisp, enabling them offensively.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Rotom-Wash","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/rotom-wash","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":107},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":107},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":86}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"pokemonFormTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:33.3788135Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Calm","natureId":"/natures/calm","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":168},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":88}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Volt Switch","moveId":"/moves/volt-switch","moveType":{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":70,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User switches out after damaging the target."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Hydro Pump","moveId":"/moves/hydro-pump","moveType":{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":110,"moveAccuracy":80,"moveDetails":"No additional effect."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Thunder Wave","moveId":"/moves/thunder-wave","moveType":{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Paralyzes the target."},{"moveName":"Will-O-Wisp","moveId":"/moves/will-o-wisp","moveType":{"typeName":"Fire","typeId":"/types/fire"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":85,"moveDetails":"Burns the target."}],"strategyFourthMoves":[{"moveName":"Pain Split","moveId":"/moves/pain-split","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Shares HP of user and target equally."}]}}
