{"strategyName":"Nasty Plot","strategyId":"/strategies/nasty-plot?pokemon=hydreigon&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Nasty Plot makes Hydreigon a dangerous wallbreaker; after a boost, it can OHKO Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> with Draco Meteor and 2HKO <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> with Dark Pulse. Hydreigon should set up against Pokemon it can force out such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>. Roost alongside Leftovers lets Hydreigon find multiple opportunities to wallbreak. Flash Cannon is an option that breaks through Fairy-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/togekiss\" hreflang=\"en\">Togekiss</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a> while hitting <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> for neutral damage. With Life Orb, +2 Flash Cannon can OHKO Togekiss. However, keep in mind that Life Orb will force Hydreigon to use Roost more often and quickly wear down sets lacking Roost.</p>\n<p>Nasty Plot Hydreigon can fit on a wide range of offense and balance styles. Entry hazard support from partners like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> can wear down foes like Azumarill and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> into KO range of its boosted attacks. These setters also help pressure and switch into Fairy-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> and Primarina. Jirachi can also provide Healing Wish support for sets lacking Roost. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ribombee\" hreflang=\"en\">Ribombee</a> can provide Sticky Web to let Hydreigon beat revenge killers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> and Jirachi. However, other fast Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> are immune to Sticky Web, so offensive partners like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a> and Lycanroc-D are useful to keep them in check. These partners also remove specially defensive walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>. Hydreigon can struggle to find setup opportunities, so pivots such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a> can give it chances against Pokemon like Rotom-W and Slowking. Fighting-type checks such as Primarina, Amoonguss, and the aforementioned Moltres are necessary, as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/cobalion\" hreflang=\"en\">Cobalion</a> can easily revenge kill Hydreigon. Late-game cleaners like Excadrill and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a> appreciate Hydreigon breaking through defensive Pokemon such as Slowking, Celesteela, and Tangrowth.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Hydreigon","pokemonId":"/pokemon/hydreigon","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":92},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":98}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:40.2788186Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."},{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Nasty Plot","moveId":"/moves/nasty-plot","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Sp.
