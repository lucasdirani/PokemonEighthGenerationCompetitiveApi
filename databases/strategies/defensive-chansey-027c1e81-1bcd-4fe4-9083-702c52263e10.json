{"strategyName":"Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive?pokemon=chansey&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Seismic Toss makes Chansey less passive, since it deals reliable damage to all but Ghost-types. Toxic helps Chansey wear down opposing Pokemon, especially bulky foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>. Teleport is a great support move to bring other teammates safely onto the battlefield and to keep up momentum on more offensive teams. Since Chansey has little to fear from many special attackers, it can force switches and get many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Chansey can use Aromatherapy to support its teammates; however, this is usually only considered on balance and stall teams. Thunder Wave can be used instead of Toxic to support slow teammates, but it makes Chansey weaker against bulky Pokemon and has less use overall. Maximum investment in Defense and HP alongside a Bold nature allows Chansey to check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/starmie\" hreflang=\"en\">Starmie</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> as well as weaker physical attackers such <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a> more effectively.</p>\n<p>Chansey can fit on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams as a sturdy wall for special attackers. Sturdy physical walls such as Tangrowth and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> can check threatening wallbreakers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diggersby\" hreflang=\"en\">Diggersby</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a> for Chansey. In return, Chansey checks strong special attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, Moltres, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>, Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zygarde-10\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde-10%</a> appreciate Teleport Chansey's ability to bring them safely onto the battlefield. Since entry hazards limit Chansey's ability to switch into attacks and force it to recover more, entry hazard control from Salamence, Skarmory, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> is crucial. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/quagsire\" hreflang=\"en\">Quagsire</a> can check threatening setup sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>, Aegislash, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a>, with Umbreon also offering Wish support to Chansey's teammates and a check to physical threats such as Zygarde-10%, Mamoswine, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ditto\" hreflang=\"en\">Ditto</a> is also an option to keep offensive setup sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> and Gyarados in check. A good Knock Off absorber such as Tangrowth, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, or <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/cobalion\" hreflang=\"en\">Cobalion</a> is helpful, as Chansey needs Eviolite to better switch into attacks. Amoonguss is also able to check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> and Azumarill.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Chansey","pokemonId":"/pokemon/chansey","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":250},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":5},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":5},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":35},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":50}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Natural Cure","abilityId":"/abilities/natural-cure","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon has its non-volatile status condition cured when it switches out."},{"abilityName":"Serene Grace","abilityId":"/abilities/serene-grace","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves have their secondary effect chance doubled."},{"abilityName":"Healer","abilityId":"/abilities/healer","abilityDetails":"30% chance of curing an adjacent ally's status at the end of each turn."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:25.0646335Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Eviolite","itemId":"/items/eviolite","itemDetails":"If holder's species can evolve, its Defense and Sp.
