{"strategyName":"Three Attacks","strategyId":"/strategies/three-attacks?pokemon=hydreigon&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Dark Pulse's acceptable power and overall solid coverage let Hydreigon consistently pressure Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> and consistently damage the majority of the tier. Earth Power OHKOes <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>, hits <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a> for super effective damage, and hits most Dark-resistant Pokemon neutrally. Flash Cannon provides coverage for <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> while still hitting <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a> for super effective damage. Roost is mandatory to consistently pivot into Pokemon such as the aforementioned Heatran, Toxapex, and Slowking. Draco Meteor can be used over Flash Cannon or Earth Power to heavily dent most Pokemon, better pressure <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> as well as defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragonite\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragonite</a>, and OHKO <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>, although the Special Attack drop usually forces Hydreigon to switch out after. Flamethrower can also be used over either coverage move to better pressure <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>. Life Orb is the best item for this set, as it allows Hydreigon to OHKO Heatran as well as 2HKO Clefable and Slowking. However, if your team needs Hydreigon's defensive capabilities, Leftovers lets it stay around longer, pivot into Heatran's Magma Storm more consistently, and negate burn damage from Pokemon such as Toxapex and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>.</p>\n<p>Grass-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> put both Ferrothorn and Corviknight in 2HKO range of Dark Pulse by using Knock Off as they switch in; in return, Hydreigon offers a consistent switch-in to Heatran, which can be especially helpful if either one of them is Choice locked into a Grass-type move. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>, when paired with Hydreigon, can overwhelm shared checks such as Clefable and Ferrothorn. Steel-types such as Corviknight, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a>, and Heatran can check Fairy-types and appreciate Hydreigon checking Heatran; Scizor also has the added benefit of checking <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a>, while Heatran can help overwhelm Tyranitar and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a>. Pivots that can bring Hydreigon safely are solid teammates as well; <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> can lure in Ground-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and Hippowdon and use U-turn to bring Hydreigon in. Corviknight is another U-turn pivot that can lure in <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> and Toxapex for Hydreigon. Slowking and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a> can also pivot with Teleport, and Slowking can help overwhelm foes with Future Sight in combination with Hydreigon's attacks; the two also have decent defensive synergy with Hydreigon. Toxapex has good defensive synergy with Hydreigon and appreciates it stopping Heatran from trapping it. Clefable appreciates Hydreigon checking Heatran and can even heal status effects from it, like Toxic poison from Heatran and Toxapex, with Aromatherapy.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Hydreigon","pokemonId":"/pokemon/hydreigon","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":92},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":98}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:40.2838061Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."},{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Dark Pulse","moveId":"/moves/dark-pulse","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"20% chance to make the target flinch."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Earth Power","moveId":"/moves/earth-power","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to lower the target's Sp.
