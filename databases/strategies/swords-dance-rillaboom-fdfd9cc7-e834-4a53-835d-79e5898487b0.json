{"strategyName":"Swords Dance","strategyId":"/strategies/swords-dance?pokemon=rillaboom&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>The immediate power of Grassy Glide means that, if it is safely brought in, Rillaboom can force plenty of switches and set up, such as against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-fini\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Fini</a> or <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>. At +2, boosted by a Life Orb and Grassy Terrain, Grassy Glide is immensely powerful, capable of KOing virtually all neutral threats and even doing high damage to resistant Pokemon. Knock Off complements Grassy Glide well, punishing switch-ins by removing items such as the Heavy-Duty Boots of Flying-types. Wood Hammer can be opted for here instead; it is extremely powerful, often eliminating the need for prediction, and OHKOes the likes of Unaware <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, which otherwise frustrates both this set and hyper offense generally. Wood Hammer also inflicts high damage to Flying-type switch-ins, helping a common teammate in <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> clean later in the game with Knock Off, therefore making Knock Off redundant on Rillaboom itself. Superpower OHKOes Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a> and 2HKOes <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> even when factoring in the Attack drop. A Jolly nature allows Rillaboom to outspeed and KO Modest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a>, Modest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, and offensive Heatran while also getting the jump on <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> to pressure it with boosted Knock Offs or Wood Hammers.</p>\n<p>This set is best run on hyper offense builds that appreciate Rillaboom’s powerful priority and ability to break past defensive checks. Superpower helps soften Skarmory and Corviknight to let physical attackers like Urshifu-R and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a> sweep later. Kartana is a notable partner; though the pair fulfill greatly redundant offensive roles, one can wallbreak for the other to sweep later, with Grassy Terrain making Kartana’s Leaf Blade spammable against even resisted switch-ins. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a> stands out as the single best partner for Rillaboom, punishing and discouraging predictable switches into Skarmory and Corviknight so it can more freely attack. Grassy Seed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hawlucha\" hreflang=\"en\">Hawlucha</a> is a great partner for Rillaboom, giving hyper offense builds an unparalleled Speed tier and terrifying wallbreaker in one teamslot while also aiding Rillaboom’s weakness to <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a>. Moreover, Rillaboom is able to bust past the likes of Clefable, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a>, setting up Hawlucha to sweep in the endgame.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Rillaboom","pokemonId":"/pokemon/rillaboom","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":85}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Overgrow","abilityId":"/abilities/overgrow","abilityDetails":"At 1/3 or less of its max HP, this Pokemon's attacking stat is 1.5x with Grass attacks."},{"abilityName":"Grassy Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/grassy-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Grassy Terrain."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:44.133426Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Grassy Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/grassy-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Grassy Terrain."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Adamant","natureId":"/natures/adamant","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"}},{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Swords Dance","moveId":"/moves/swords-dance","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Attack by 2."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Grassy Glide","moveId":"/moves/grassy-glide","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":70,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User on Grassy Terrain: +1 priority."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Knock Off","moveId":"/moves/knock-off","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":65,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"1.5x damage if foe holds an item.
