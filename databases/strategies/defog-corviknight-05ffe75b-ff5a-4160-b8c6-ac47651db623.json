{"strategyName":"Defog","strategyId":"/strategies/defog?pokemon=corviknight&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>The listed EV spread allows Corviknight to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>'s Psychic after Stealth Rock damage as well as the 2HKO from Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>'s Shadow Ball from full HP. Maximum HP and Defense EVs is an alternative, although it takes considerably more damage from special attacks. Body Press OHKOes <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/bisharp\" hreflang=\"en\">Bisharp</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a> while also dealing decent damage to incoming Steel-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a>. U-turn is what makes Corviknight a great pivot, allowing it to keep momentum against Pokemon that switch in to it. Brave Bird is an alternative that hits <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a> for super effective damage and prevents it from being setup fodder for the latter. However, teams especially weak to physical setup sweepers such as Swords Dance <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> can make use of Iron Defense to completely wall those Pokemon while also making Body Press stronger. Corviknight's ability to wall most hazard setters makes it an excellent Defog user. Leftovers helps check more Pokemon in the long run thanks to the passive recovery. Rocky Helmet deals chip damage to U-turn and Knock Off spam and dissuades Urshifu-R from using Surging Strikes. Corviknight is often switching in on Knock Off from Pokemon such as Weavile, Bisharp, Rillaboom, and Kartana, so its item rarely lasts the entire match.</p>\n<p>Many team archetypes appreciate Corviknight as a Defogger thanks to its strong defensive presence and pivoting ability. Defensive teams greatly appreciate its longevity and ability to take Knock Off, while more offensive teams take great advantage of its pivoting. Corviknight appreciates <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, Garchomp, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a> switching into Electric-type attacks from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> that threaten it. These Pokemon also threaten Heatran, one of the few Stealth Rock setters able to beat Corviknight. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a>, and Heatran switch into Fire-types that threaten Corviknight such as Heatran for the former two and Volcarona for the latter two. Slowking and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a> also sponge special attacks from Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> that Corviknight has trouble repeatedly taking, and they can safely pivot into it with Teleport against strong physical attackers that threaten them like Kartana, Rillaboom, and Urshifu-R. Another great teammate is <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, as it appreciates Corviknight's ability to take on physical attackers that threaten it like Rillaboom, Bisharp, and Kartana, while Clefable takes on Dragon-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, Dragapult, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> that threaten Corviknight. It also can heal status with Aromatherapy. Strong wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Urshifu-R, Bisharp, and Dragapult appreciate Corviknight's slow pivoting with U-turn getting them in safely.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Corviknight","pokemonId":"/pokemon/corviknight","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":98},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":87},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":53},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":67}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Pressure","abilityId":"/abilities/pressure","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon is the target of a foe's move, that move loses one additional PP."},{"abilityName":"Unnerve","abilityId":"/abilities/unnerve","abilityDetails":"While this Pokemon is active, it prevents opposing Pokemon from using their Berries."},{"abilityName":"Mirror Armor","abilityId":"/abilities/mirror-armor","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon's stat stages would be lowered, the attacker's are lowered instead."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:36.9222295Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."},{"itemName":"Rocky Helmet","itemId":"/items/rocky-helmet","itemDetails":"If holder is hit by a contact move, the attacker loses 1/6 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Pressure","abilityId":"/abilities/pressure","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon is the target of a foe's move, that move loses one additional PP."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Impish","natureId":"/natures/impish","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":168},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":88},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Body Press","moveId":"/moves/body-press","moveType":{"typeName":"Fighting","typeId":"/types/fighting"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Uses user's Def stat as Atk in damage calculation."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"U-turn","moveId":"/moves/u-turn","moveType":{"typeName":"Bug","typeId":"/types/bug"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":70,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User switches out after damaging the target."},{"moveName":"Brave Bird","moveId":"/moves/brave-bird","moveType":{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":120,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Has 33% recoil."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Defog","moveId":"/moves/defog","moveType":{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"-1 evasion; clears terrain and hazards on both sides."}],"strategyFourthMoves":[{"moveName":"Roost","moveId":"/moves/roost","moveType":{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Heals 50% HP.
