  "strategyDetails": "The listed EV spread allows Corviknight to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Psychic after Stealth Rock damage as well as the 2HKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball from full HP. Maximum HP and Defense EVs is an alternative, although it takes considerably more damage from special attacks. Body Press OHKOes Bisharp and Weavile while also dealing decent damage to incoming Steel-types such as Heatran and Magnezone. U-turn is what makes Corviknight a great pivot, allowing it to keep momentum against Pokemon that switch in to it. Brave Bird is an alternative that hits Rillaboom, Urshifu-R, and Volcarona for super effective damage and prevents it from being setup fodder for the latter. However, teams especially weak to physical setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Garchomp and Kartana can make use of Iron Defense to completely wall those Pokemon while also making Body Press stronger. Corviknight's ability to wall most hazard setters makes it an excellent Defog user. Leftovers helps check more Pokemon in the long run thanks to the passive recovery. Rocky Helmet deals chip damage to U-turn and Knock Off spam and dissuades Urshifu-R from using Surging Strikes. Corviknight is often switching in on Knock Off from Pokemon such as Weavile, Bisharp, Rillaboom, and Kartana, so its item rarely lasts the entire match. Many team archetypes appreciate Corviknight as a Defogger thanks to its strong defensive presence and pivoting ability. Defensive teams greatly appreciate its longevity and ability to take Knock Off, while more offensive teams take great advantage of its pivoting. Corviknight appreciates Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon switching into Electric-type attacks from Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Zapdos that threaten it. These Pokemon also threaten Heatran, one of the few Stealth Rock setters able to beat Corviknight. Slowking, Toxapex, and Heatran switch into Fire-types that threaten Corviknight such as Heatran for the former two and Volcarona for the latter two. Slowking and Blissey also sponge special attacks from Pokemon such as Nidoking that Corviknight has trouble repeatedly taking, and they can safely pivot into it with Teleport against strong physical attackers that threaten them like Kartana, Rillaboom, and Urshifu-R. Another great teammate is Clefable, as it appreciates Corviknight's ability to take on physical attackers that threaten it like Rillaboom, Bisharp, and Kartana, while Clefable takes on Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Dragapult, and Kyurem that threaten Corviknight. It also can heal status with Aromatherapy. Strong wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Urshifu-R, Bisharp, and Dragapult appreciate Corviknight's slow pivoting with U-turn getting them in safely.",
