Synthesis is reliable recovery, but it should only be used sparingly due to its low PP. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item, but Rocky Helmet can be used to punish contact moves from Zarude, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>. The EV spread is to outspeed Choice Specs Primarina while maximizing physical bulk to better check Buzzwole and Lycanroc-D.</p>\n<p>Defensive Tapu Bulu is mainly found on stall and balance teams, as they appreciate it bringing Grassy Terrain for extra recovery.

In return, Tapu Bulu is able to handle Krookodile, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a>, Zarude, and Crawdaunt for these Pokemon. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> is able to check non-Dragon Dance Salamence and other special attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>; Tapu Bulu beats <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a>, one of the few special attackers that can break through Chansey. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> provides Wish support so that Tapu Bulu does not have to use Synthesis often while also checking Salamence and Aegislash.
