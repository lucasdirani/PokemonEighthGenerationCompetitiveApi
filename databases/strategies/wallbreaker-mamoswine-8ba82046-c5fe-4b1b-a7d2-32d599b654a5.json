{"strategyName":"Wallbreaker","strategyId":"/strategies/wallbreaker?pokemon=mamoswine&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Icicle Crash and Earthquake are a devastatingly powerful STAB combination, easily KOing common walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>. Ice Shard can threaten many faster threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>, and it can also OHKO offensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zygarde-10\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde-10%</a>. Knock Off is used to punish and cripple switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> or <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>, allowing Mamoswine or another teammate to break past it more easily later. Thick Fat offers better protection against Rotom-H and ensures it can take a Fire Blast from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>. Life Orb is preferred, as it allows Mamoswine to safely 2HKO almost anything in the tier, including <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>. However, Never-Melt Ice also is an option to retain a powerful Icicle Crash while not wearing itself down with Life Orb, but this comes at the cost of a much weaker Earthquake, missing out on a 2HKO on <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, even after Stealth Rock. An Adamant Nature maximizes Mamoswine's wallbreaking potential, though a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed unboosted Galarian Moltres and Timid <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcanion\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcanion</a> at the cost of lots of power.</p>\n<p>Mamoswine best functions on offensive teams that provide it many opportunities to wallbreak. Late-game cleaners like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salazzle\" hreflang=\"en\">Salazzle</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a> appreciate Mamoswine's early-game wallbreaking and can deal with faster threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/cobalion\" hreflang=\"en\">Cobalion</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> as well as walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>. Salazzle also can wear down Slowking, allowing Mamoswine to break through it easier. Pivots like Zarude and Slowking lure in Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a> and Amoonguss and then pivot to Mamoswine for a more favorable matchup; Slowking in particular provides slow pivoting with Teleport to get Mamoswine in safely. Mamoswine is vulnerable to priority moves from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/crawdaunt\" hreflang=\"en\">Crawdaunt</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>; Amoonguss can switch into most of these. Entry hazard support from Cobalion and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> can wear down Pokemon like Skarmory and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> for Mamoswine to break past them more easily. Similarly, entry hazard control from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a> can remove opposing entry hazards that would wear Mamoswine down. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> helps check faster threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> and works well with Mamoswine to overwhelm walls like Primarina and Celesteela.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Mamoswine","pokemonId":"/pokemon/mamoswine","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Ice","typeId":"/types/ice"},{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":80}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Thick Fat","abilityId":"/abilities/thick-fat","abilityDetails":"Fire/Ice-type moves against this Pokemon deal damage with a halved attacking stat."},{"abilityName":"Oblivious","abilityId":"/abilities/oblivious","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon cannot be infatuated or taunted.
