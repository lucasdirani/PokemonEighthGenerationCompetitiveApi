{"strategyName":"Iron Defense","strategyId":"/strategies/iron-defense?pokemon=magnezone&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Iron Defense + Body Press Magnezone traps Pokemon that its STAB moves cannot threaten while also pressuring certain special walls that can switch into its attacks otherwise, such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> is the main target, as it is one of the best defensive Steel-types that resists Electric and Steel, but this set is still able to trap typical targets like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> with Thunderbolt. Substitute is very useful to block common status moves such as Ferrothorn's Leech Seed and get one more hit off after taking down a Steel-type. Toxic allows Magnezone to badly poison switch-ins such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a> that can exploit Magnezone, while Teleport allows for Magnezone to gain momentum against them and other Ground-type Pokemon instead.</p>\n<p>With how easily Magnezone can remove Skarmory, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn, among other foes, physical setup sweepers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragonite\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragonite</a> can be much more effective. Iron Defense Magnezone will typically have a hard time breaking through Pokemon that aren't Steel-types due to the lack of offensive investment, meaning it needs strong defensive pivots to help when it gets in a bad position. Teammates like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> can pivot into strong Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>, while Ground-type answers such as Corviknight and Landorus-T can cover Magnezone against attackers like Garchomp and opposing Landorus-T. Magnezone also appreciates strong wallbreakers to stop walls from taking momentum after it traps a foe, so Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a>, Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a> are good fits to break foes it can't even when boosted.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Magnezone","pokemonId":"/pokemon/magnezone","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":115},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":60}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sturdy","abilityId":"/abilities/sturdy","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon is at full HP, it survives one hit with at least 1 HP.
