  "strategyDetails": "Nasty Plot lets Tornadus-T become an intimidating wallbreaker, giving it the power to break through common specially defensive Pokemon such as Heatran and Ferrothorn with ease. Its Speed tier notably lets it outspeed most unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, including Kartana and other fast offensive threats, making it difficult to revenge kill and easy to sweep with. Focus Blast lets Tornadus-T hit Tyranitar and Steel-type switch-ins such as Heatran super effectively. Knock Off is used as a consistent means of punishing defensive switch-ins like Zapdos, Heatran, and Blissey by removing their item to force progress and make them more vulnerable to other threats in the long run. Heat Wave can be used over Focus Blast or Knock Off for the ability to hit Corviknight harder and its superior accuracy at the expense of hitting Heatran and Tyranitar super effectively and crippling certain switch-ins. Heavy-Duty Boots enables Tornadus-T to pivot in and out freely and maintain offensive pressure on opposing teams, as well as keeping some defensive utility against Pokemon like Rillaboom and Kartana that Tornadus-T is able to situationally switch into. Nasty Plot Tornadus-T fits well on bulky offense and balance teams because of its amazing wallbreaking power and team support through Knock Off, making it versatile throughout a game. Garchomp and Landorus-T are great partners to Tornadus-T because of the pressure they exert on Electric-types such as Zapdos and Tapu Koko that would otherwise freely pivot into Tornadus-T. Stealth Rock and Toxic or Knock Off support from either of these Pokemon can also help Tornadus-T break through these Electric-types more easily. They also appreciate Tornadus-T's pressure on Grass-type checks such as Tangrowth. Nasty Plot + Knock Off Tornadus-T assists Pokemon that struggle to break past specially defensive walls such as Heatran and Galarian Slowking, like Tapu Lele and Calm Mind Clefable. Tornadus-T is especially dangerous when paired with other strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Kartana, as it can overwhelm shared checks like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight. Ferrothorn is also a potent defensive partner because of Tornadus-T's ability to cripple Heatran and other switch-ins with Knock Off, making Ferrothorn's entry hazards more useful in steadily chipping walls.",
