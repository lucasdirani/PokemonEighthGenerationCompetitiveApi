{"strategyName":"Nasty Plot","strategyId":"/strategies/nasty-plot?pokemon=tornadus-therian&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Nasty Plot lets Tornadus-T become an intimidating wallbreaker, giving it the power to break through common specially defensive Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> with ease. Its Speed tier notably lets it outspeed most unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, including <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> and other fast offensive threats, making it difficult to revenge kill and easy to sweep with. Focus Blast lets Tornadus-T hit <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a> and Steel-type switch-ins such as Heatran super effectively. Knock Off is used as a consistent means of punishing defensive switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, Heatran, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a> by removing their item to force progress and make them more vulnerable to other threats in the long run. Heat Wave can be used over Focus Blast or Knock Off for the ability to hit <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> harder and its superior accuracy at the expense of hitting Heatran and Tyranitar super effectively and crippling certain switch-ins. Heavy-Duty Boots enables Tornadus-T to pivot in and out freely and maintain offensive pressure on opposing teams, as well as keeping some defensive utility against Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and Kartana that Tornadus-T is able to situationally switch into.</p>\n<p>Nasty Plot Tornadus-T fits well on bulky offense and balance teams because of its amazing wallbreaking power and team support through Knock Off, making it versatile throughout a game. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> are great partners to Tornadus-T because of the pressure they exert on Electric-types such as Zapdos and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> that would otherwise freely pivot into Tornadus-T. Stealth Rock and Toxic or Knock Off support from either of these Pokemon can also help Tornadus-T break through these Electric-types more easily. They also appreciate Tornadus-T's pressure on Grass-type checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>. Nasty Plot + Knock Off Tornadus-T assists Pokemon that struggle to break past specially defensive walls such as Heatran and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a> and Calm Mind <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>. Tornadus-T is especially dangerous when paired with other strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Kartana, as it can overwhelm shared checks like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight. Ferrothorn is also a potent defensive partner because of Tornadus-T's ability to cripple Heatran and other switch-ins with Knock Off, making Ferrothorn's entry hazards more useful in steadily chipping walls.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemonForms":{"pokemonFormName":"Tornadus-Therian","pokemonFormId":"/pokemon-forms/tornadus-therian","pokemonFormTypes":[{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonFormBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":79},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":121}],"pokemonFormAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Regenerator","abilityId":"/abilities/regenerator","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon restores 1/3 of its maximum HP, rounded down, when it switches out."}],"pokemonFormTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:48.2026145Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Regenerator","abilityId":"/abilities/regenerator","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon restores 1/3 of its maximum HP, rounded down, when it switches out."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Nasty Plot","moveId":"/moves/nasty-plot","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Sp.
