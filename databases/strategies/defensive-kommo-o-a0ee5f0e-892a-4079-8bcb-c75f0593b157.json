{"strategyName":"Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive?pokemon=kommo-o&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Kommo-o is a pretty solid Stealth Rock setter, capable of pressuring the most common forms of entry hazard removal in <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>. Beyond that, it has a very solid matchup against sun teams in general, notably checking <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/venusaur\" hreflang=\"en\">Venusaur</a>. Kommo-o fits best on balance teams that need to improve their matchup against sun teams and need a solid Stealth Rock setter. Kommo-o synergizes very well with Wish <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, as it is otherwise quickly worn down. It is also important to have counterplay to Clefable, as Kommo-o often baits it into play, so Pokemon like Excadrill and Corviknight are solid teammates.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Kommo-o","pokemonId":"/pokemon/kommo-o","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},{"typeName":"Fighting","typeId":"/types/fighting"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":85}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Soundproof","abilityId":"/abilities/soundproof","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to sound-based moves, including Heal Bell."},{"abilityName":"Overcoat","abilityId":"/abilities/overcoat","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to powder moves and damage from Sandstorm or Hail."},{"abilityName":"Bulletproof","abilityId":"/abilities/bulletproof","abilityDetails":"Makes user immune to ballistic moves (Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, Focus Blast, etc)."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:28.426252Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."},{"itemName":"Rocky Helmet","itemId":"/items/rocky-helmet","itemDetails":"If holder is hit by a contact move, the attacker loses 1/6 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Bulletproof","abilityId":"/abilities/bulletproof","abilityDetails":"Makes user immune to ballistic moves (Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, Focus Blast, etc)."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Impish","natureId":"/natures/impish","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}},{"natureName":"Bold","natureId":"/natures/bold","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":148},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":40},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":68}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Body Press","moveId":"/moves/body-press","moveType":{"typeName":"Fighting","typeId":"/types/fighting"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Uses user's Def stat as Atk in damage calculation."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Earthquake","moveId":"/moves/earthquake","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Hits adjacent Pokemon.
