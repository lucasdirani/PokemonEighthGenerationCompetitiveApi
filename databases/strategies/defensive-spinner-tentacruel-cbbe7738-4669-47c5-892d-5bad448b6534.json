{"strategyName":"Defensive Spinner","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive-spinner?pokemon=tentacruel&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Sludge Bomb prevents Tentacruel from being too passive and hits foes such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>. It also has a chance to poison, which is useful for crippling threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/suicune\" hreflang=\"en\">Suicune</a>. Rapid Spin can provide a boost to Tentacruel's Speed, letting it outspeed common Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/noivern\" hreflang=\"en\">Noivern</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a>. Knock Off cripples checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/seismitoad\" hreflang=\"en\">Seismitoad</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gastrodon\" hreflang=\"en\">Gastrodon</a>. Haze allows Tentacruel to shut down setup sweepers like Clangorous Soul <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a>, Calm Mind <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>, and Belly Drum Azumarill, which can take advantage of its passivity. Black Sludge gives Tentacruel a form of recovery, which it completely lacks otherwise. Liquid Ooze punishes draining moves such as Leech Seed, allowing it to deal passive damage to foes that rely on these moves for recovery, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>. A Timid nature and 144 Speed EVs allow Tentacruel to outspeed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chandelure\" hreflang=\"en\">Chandelure</a>, and maximum Speed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense to more easily deal with Lycanroc-D and Azumarill.</p>\n<p>Tentacruel is best used on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to remove entry hazards. Entry hazard setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a> benefit greatly from Tentacruel removing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and clearing entry hazards solely from its side of the field, which let them fully capitalize on their entry hazards. Krookodile also sports crucial immunities to Electric and Psychic, which allow it to check foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a> for Tentacruel. Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu provide switch-ins to some of Tentacruel's biggest checks such as Thundurus-T, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/raikou\" hreflang=\"en\">Raikou</a>, and Krookodile. The latter can also set up Grassy Terrain, which provides Tentacruel with another source of recovery and weakens Earthquake. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/sylveon\" hreflang=\"en\">Sylveon</a> provides Wish support for Tentacruel, another form of recovery, and acts as a secondary check to <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a>. Pokemon like Salamence, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> appreciate Tentacruel's Rapid Spin allowing them to forego Defog. Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and Jirachi are greatly valued as partners for Tentacruel, as they can check Psychic- and Dragon-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/reuniclus\" hreflang=\"en\">Reuniclus</a> and Kommo-o, which Tentacruel struggles with.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Tentacruel","pokemonId":"/pokemon/tentacruel","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Poison","typeId":"/types/poison"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":120},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":100}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Liquid Ooze","abilityId":"/abilities/liquid-ooze","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon damages those draining HP from it for as much as they would heal."},{"abilityName":"Clear Body","abilityId":"/abilities/clear-body","abilityDetails":"Prevents other Pokemon from lowering this Pokemon's stat stages."},{"abilityName":"Rain Dish","abilityId":"/abilities/rain-dish","abilityDetails":"If Rain Dance is active, this Pokemon heals 1/16 of its max HP each turn."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:35.1232351Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Black Sludge","itemId":"/items/black-sludge","itemDetails":"Each turn, if holder is a Poison type, restores 1/16 max HP; loses 1/8 if not."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Liquid Ooze","abilityId":"/abilities/liquid-ooze","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon damages those draining HP from it for as much as they would heal."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":112},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":144}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Scald","moveId":"/moves/scald","moveType":{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"30% chance to burn the target.
