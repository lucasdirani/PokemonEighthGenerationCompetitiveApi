{"strategyName":"Swords Dance","strategyId":"/strategies/swords-dance?pokemon=tapu-bulu&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Horn Leech is Tapu Bulu's most effective STAB move, as its recovery offsets Life Orb recoil and is very strong under Grassy Terrain. Close Combat allows Tapu Bulu to hit Steel-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>. Stone Edge is great coverage to hit Pokemon that resist its other moves like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragonite\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragonite</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>. Life Orb guarantees OHKOs at +2 on Mandibuzz and defensive Dragonite when Multiscale is inactive. Leftovers is an alternative over Life Orb, as it stacks with Grassy Terrain for better longevity, though the reduced damage is very noticeable. Jolly is the preferred nature to allow it to be faster than defensive Zapdos and neutral nature <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, but Adamant is also an option for more damage output. An EV spread of 32 HP / 252 Atk / 224 Spe can be used along with an Adamant nature, which makes Tapu Bulu faster than positive nature <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/magnezone\" hreflang=\"en\">Magnezone</a>, while the HP gives it an extra point of recovery while Grassy Terrain is up.</p>\n<p>Tapu Bulu best fits on offense and bulky offense teams in need of a strong wallbreaker that can offensively check the likes of <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>. Heatran takes on <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> while also setting Stealth Rock. In return, Tapu Bulu checks Water-types such as Urshifu-R and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> while providing Terrain support. Volcarona, Heatran, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> can threaten Tapu Bulu, so switch-ins for them such as Slowking and defensive Dragonite can cover for it while alleviating its pressure to check Urshifu-R. The former is also able to handle faster wallbreakers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a> and Tornadus-T, while the latter is able to provide Tapu Bulu Heal Bell support. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> is able to lure in targets that Tapu Bulu takes advantage of like Ferrothorn and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a> and bring it in with U-turn out while providing a great check to Tornadus-T. Magnezone can remove Corviknight and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> so Tapu Bulu doesn't have to force its way past them, and it benefits from Grassy Terrain decreasing the damage of Earthquake. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> is a great partner alongside Tapu Bulu, overwhelming teams once Tapu Bulu removes Flying-types like Zapdos, defensive Dragonite, and Mandibuzz with its powerful coverage. Grassy Terrain also complements its Leaf Blade.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Tapu Bulu","pokemonId":"/pokemon/tapu-bulu","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":115},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":75}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Telepathy","abilityId":"/abilities/telepathy","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon does not take damage from attacks made by its allies."},{"abilityName":"Grassy Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/grassy-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Grassy Terrain."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:34.7754238Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Grassy Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/grassy-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Grassy Terrain."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}},{"natureName":"Adamant","natureId":"/natures/adamant","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Swords Dance","moveId":"/moves/swords-dance","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Attack by 2."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Horn Leech","moveId":"/moves/horn-leech","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":75,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User recovers 50% of the damage dealt."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Close Combat","moveId":"/moves/close-combat","moveType":{"typeName":"Fighting","typeId":"/types/fighting"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":120,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Lowers the user's Defense and Sp.
