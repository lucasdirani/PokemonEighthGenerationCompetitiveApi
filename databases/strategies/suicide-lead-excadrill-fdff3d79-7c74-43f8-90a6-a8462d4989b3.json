{"strategyName":"Suicide Lead","strategyId":"/strategies/suicide-lead?pokemon=excadrill&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Excadrill is a great suicide lead for hyper offense teams thanks to Mold Breaker, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> and pressure <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> with Earthquake. Rapid Spin supports its team against opposing Stealth Rock setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>. Excadrill also keeps Sticky Web off the field thanks to its amazing matchup against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ribombee\" hreflang=\"en\">Ribombee</a>, which normally hinders many hyper offense teams. Rock Tomb heavily damages <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a> and slows down faster threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> for its teammates to set up on. Alternatively, Steel Beam allows Excadrill to retain momentum after setting up Stealth Rock, preventing Defoggers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> from removing Stealth Rock. A Focus Sash guarantees Excadrill can survive a hit and get up Stealth Rock before fainting.</p>\n<p>This Excadrill set fits best on hyper offense teams, allowing teammates to come in and sweep after setting up Stealth Rock. Deadly setup sweepers like Thundurus-T, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a> all appreciate entry hazard support wearing down checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, and Nihilego. Thundurus-T takes advantage of the Flying-types Excadrill lets in like Skarmory and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, while the latter two also appreciate Excadrill removing opposing Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, preventing chip damage so they can sweep more easily. Rapid Spin support also allows these Pokemon to run other items like Mystic Water and Sitrus Berry instead of Heavy-Duty Boots. Spikes leads like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scolipede\" hreflang=\"en\">Scolipede</a> can form an entry hazard stacking core with Excadrill.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Excadrill","pokemonId":"/pokemon/excadrill","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":135},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":88}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Mold Breaker","abilityId":"/abilities/mold-breaker","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves and their effects ignore the Abilities of other Pokemon."},{"abilityName":"Sand Force","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-force","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Ground/Rock/Steel attacks do 1.3x in Sandstorm; immunity to it."},{"abilityName":"Sand Rush","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-rush","abilityDetails":"If Sandstorm is active, this Pokemon's Speed is doubled; immunity to Sandstorm."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:38.2313145Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Focus Sash","itemId":"/items/focus-sash","itemDetails":"If holder's HP is full, will survive an attack that would KO it with 1 HP.
