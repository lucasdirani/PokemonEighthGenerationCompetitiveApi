{"strategyName":"Tank","strategyId":"/strategies/tank?pokemon=garchomp&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Tank Garchomp is one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier because of its ability to keep entry hazards up and pressure conventional Defoggers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> with Toxic. It can take advantage of its typing and the combination of Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin to punish users of contact moves like U-turn and many physical attackers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hawlucha\" hreflang=\"en\">Hawlucha</a>. Protect is useful to scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and Choice Band <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, and it is especially useful on Leftovers sets for better recovery every other turn. Flamethrower is an option to pressure Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, which would otherwise be free to set up their own entry hazards or remove Garchomp's Stealth Rock. It can also help Garchomp check offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana that take little damage from Earthquake. Rest gives added longevity and removes status caused by Pokemon Garchomp switches into, including <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and Zapdos. 120 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Garchomp outspeed maximum Speed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, most defensive Landorus-T, and maximum Speed Heatran.</p>\n<p>Physically defensive Garchomp provides entry hazard support that Pokemon like Kartana and Rillaboom benefit from. They can use Knock Off to help Garchomp pressure Flying-type Defoggers such as Zapdos and Mandibuzz that check them and appreciate Garchomp's pressure on other checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>. However, Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain weakening Earthquake usually warrants a replacement STAB move in either Stomping Tantrum or Scorching Sands. Garchomp's strain on Defoggers can help other dedicated entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> is also a good partner due to its pressure on Flying-types—especially <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and Skarmory—that can free up Garchomp's fourth moveslot, and it benefits from Garchomp's pressure on Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a> through Toxic and Earthquake. Garchomp's immense pressure on Heatran and Galarian Slowking, specifically, can also make special attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a> and Calm Mind <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> ideal teammates.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Garchomp","pokemonId":"/pokemon/garchomp","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":108},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":102}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Rough Skin","abilityId":"/abilities/rough-skin","abilityDetails":"Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon lose 1/8 of their max HP."},{"abilityName":"Sand Veil","abilityId":"/abilities/sand-veil","abilityDetails":"If Sandstorm is active, this Pokemon's evasiveness is 1.25x; immunity to Sandstorm."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:38.9446069Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."},{"itemName":"Rocky Helmet","itemId":"/items/rocky-helmet","itemDetails":"If holder is hit by a contact move, the attacker loses 1/6 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Rough Skin","abilityId":"/abilities/rough-skin","abilityDetails":"Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon lose 1/8 of their max HP."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":136},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":120}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Stealth Rock","moveId":"/moves/stealth-rock","moveType":{"typeName":"Rock","typeId":"/types/rock"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Hurts foes on switch-in.
