{"strategyName":"The Pex","strategyId":"/strategies/the-pex?pokemon=toxapex&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Scald allows Toxapex to heavily damage Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> and potentially burn and cripple foes such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>, while Knock Off allows Toxapex to cripple Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers users such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> that may switch into it. Haze prevents Toxapex from being used as setup fodder by Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragonite\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragonite</a>, Calm Mind <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/suicune\" hreflang=\"en\">Suicune</a>. Toxic is great for putting Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, Tornadus-T, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> on a timer, allowing Toxapex's offensive teammates to overwhelm them, while Toxic Spikes is an option for wearing down grounded Pokemon like Garchomp, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-fini\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Fini</a> as well as defensive Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>; unfortunately, it can easily be removed, cannot target vital non-grounded Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Hydreigon, and is often absorbed by Poison-types such as opposing Toxapex and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>, which makes it inconsistent at spreading status. Lastly, Baneful Bunker is great for crippling Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Rillaboom attempting to pivot against Toxapex and scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, as well as potentially racking up additional Black Sludge recovery. Rocky Helmet allows Toxapex to punish Pokemon such as Rillaboom and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> while also punishing U-turn attempts from Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>. Black Sludge can be used as an alternative item to gain additional recovery at the end of each turn while also helping Toxapex in Trick scenarios by crippling the Trick user. A Bold nature is generally preferred; however, an Impish can be used if Toxapex uses Knock Off over Scald.</p>\n<p>Teammates like Dragapult and Rillaboom appreciate Toxapex's ability to spread poison and remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>, Mandibuzz, and Hydreigon. Bulky Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn can be very useful for Toxapex; Heatran hard checks most of the Psychic-types in the tier, as well as being able to potentially trap and remove them with Magma Storm, whereas Ferrothorn covers Toxapex's Psychic- and Electric-type weakness and appreciates Toxapex covering its Fire- and Fighting-type weakness; in return, and run Knock Off to free up a moveslot on Toxapex for another utility option. Dark-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/obstagoon\" hreflang=\"en\">Obstagoon</a>, Hydreigon, and Mandibuzz can be very useful, as they can cover Toxapex's Future Sight weakness, making it less prone to being overwhelmed by it. Setup sweepers such as Suicune are very weak to Toxic Spikes, so they appreciate Toxapex's ability to absorb them.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Toxapex","pokemonId":"/pokemon/toxapex","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Poison","typeId":"/types/poison"},{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":63},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":152},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":53},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":142},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":35}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Limber","abilityId":"/abilities/limber","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon cannot be paralyzed.
