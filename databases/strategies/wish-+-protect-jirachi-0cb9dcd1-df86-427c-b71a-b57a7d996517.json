{"strategyName":"Wish + Protect","strategyId":"/strategies/wish-+-protect?pokemon=jirachi&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Wish keeps Jirachi healthy throughout a match, allowing it to check threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> more reliably. Jirachi can pass Wish to teammates that lack reliable recovery like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>. It distinguishes itself from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> in this role thanks to U-turn, which makes passing Wishes easier. U-turn also allows Jirachi to pivot out against threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>. Protect ensures Jirachi will receive its Wishand nets more Leftovers recovery. It also lets Jirachi scout Choice-locked threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zygarde-10\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde-10%</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>. 240 Speed EVs let Jirachi outspeed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, with the remaining EVs put in Special Defense and HP to better check Pokemon like Salamence and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>.</p>\n<p>This set best fits on balance teams, which appreciate Jirachi healing the team with Wish while bringing teammates in safely with U-turn. Wallbreakers that get worn down easily like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> greatly enjoy Wish, and U-turn can bring them in on targets like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> and Aegislash. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diancie\" hreflang=\"en\">Diancie</a>, and Swampert check threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a>. They enjoy Jirachi offsetting their lack of recovery with Wish support in return. The former two can also act as secondary checks to Salamence and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/togekiss\" hreflang=\"en\">Togekiss</a>, with Diancie supporting Jirachi with Heal Bell as well. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> can check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> and absorb Knock Off for Jirachi. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a> also checks Zarude and can beat Steel-types like Aegislash and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a> that Jirachi lures in. Zarude can bring Jirachi in safely to use Wish against Zarude's checks like Togekiss while also removing Aegislash and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> forms a great defensive core with Jirachi, being able to check threats like Moltres and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/starmie\" hreflang=\"en\">Starmie</a>. It also enjoys having the freedom to run Defog or Will-O-Wisp over Pain Split. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> can clear Spikes, while Jirachi can offset their lack of recovery.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Jirachi","pokemonId":"/pokemon/jirachi","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},{"typeName":"Psychic","typeId":"/types/psychic"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":100}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Serene Grace","abilityId":"/abilities/serene-grace","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves have their secondary effect chance doubled."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:27.3627934Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Serene Grace","abilityId":"/abilities/serene-grace","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's moves have their secondary effect chance doubled."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":16},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":240}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Wish","moveId":"/moves/wish","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Next turn, 50% of the user's max HP is restored."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Protect","moveId":"/moves/protect","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Prevents moves from affecting the user this turn."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Iron Head","moveId":"/moves/iron-head","moveType":{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"30% chance to make the target flinch."}],"strategyFourthMoves":[{"moveName":"U-turn","moveId":"/moves/u-turn","moveType":{"typeName":"Bug","typeId":"/types/bug"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":70,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User switches out after damaging the target."}]}}
