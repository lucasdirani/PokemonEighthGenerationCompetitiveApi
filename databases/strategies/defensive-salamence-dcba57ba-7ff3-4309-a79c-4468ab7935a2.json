{"strategyName":"Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive?pokemon=salamence&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Dual Wingbeat is a reliable STAB move that helps against threats to defensive teams such as Substitute <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a>. Toxic can be used instead to cripple Stealth Rock setters such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a> and wear down wallbreakers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>, though Salamence becomes much more passive against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a>. Intimidate alongside the additional HP investment makes Salamence a more sturdy switch-in to Conkeldurr and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>, although it has to be wary of the latter's Ice Fang. Maximum Speed investment is needed to make Salamence less passive against offensive threats such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>.</p>\n<p>This set is suited for stall teams to relieve entry hazard pressure from setters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> and Krookodile and check dangerous Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a> and Conkeldurr. Other entry hazard setters such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/necrozma\" hreflang=\"en\">Necrozma</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> are significant threats, so <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> can help outlast them while also providing their own Stealth Rock support. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> can check Pokemon Salamence can't handle by itself like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a> and Gyarados, and it heavily appreciates Salamence’s support against Fighting-types. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/quagsire\" hreflang=\"en\">Quagsire</a> keeps Salamence from being overwhelmed by opposing Dragon Dance Salamence and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a> and benefits from Salamence checking Grass-types. Knock Off support from teammates such as Nihilego is very beneficial so that Salamence can outlast threats such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>. Bulky Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> and Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> are useful switch-ins into special attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> and Thundurus-T. Amoonguss and physically defensive Tangrowth are also good switch-ins to Knock Off. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> can ease Salamence's role as a hazard remover with Magic Bounce.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Salamence","pokemonId":"/pokemon/salamence","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":135},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":100}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."},{"abilityName":"Moxie","abilityId":"/abilities/moxie","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Attack is raised by 1 stage if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:33.7210983Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Intimidate","abilityId":"/abilities/intimidate","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon lowers the Attack of adjacent opponents by 1 stage."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Jolly","natureId":"/natures/jolly","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":248},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":8},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Dual Wingbeat","moveId":"/moves/dual-wingbeat","moveType":{"typeName":"Flying","typeId":"/types/flying"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":40,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Hits 2 times in one turn."},{"moveName":"Toxic","moveId":"/moves/toxic","moveType":{"typeName":"Poison","typeId":"/types/poison"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Badly poisons the target.
