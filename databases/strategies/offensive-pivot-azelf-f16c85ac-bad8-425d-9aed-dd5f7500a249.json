{"strategyName":"Offensive Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/offensive-pivot?pokemon=azelf&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>U-turn lets Azelf to pivot away from switch-ins and escape counters like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a>. Knock Off offers important utility to cripple defensive switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a>. Psychic is the preferred STAB option for its greater power, threatening <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> more while OHKOing <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> and Life Orb <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a>. Psyshock is an option over Psychic to guarantee the OHKO on <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> and deal additional damage to specially defensive foes like Chansey and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>. Flamethrower allows Azelf to threaten <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>. Energy Ball is an option over U-turn on Expert Belt sets to offer greater coverage and threaten <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a>. While Timid is the preferred nature, a Naive nature can be used to deal more chip damage with U-turn and Knock Off at the expense of some survivability.</p>\n<p>Offensive pivot Azelf best fits on balance and offense teams that appreciate a fast pivot and revenge killer. Strong wallbreakers like Azumarill and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a> appreciate Azelf's pivoting and deal with Umbreon. An entry hazard setter like Excadrill, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, or <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/roserade\" hreflang=\"en\">Roserade</a> syncs well with the switches that Azelf's momentum forces, providing additional damage for it and its teammates to break through defensive cores like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> + Chansey. Offensive pivots like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> and Thundurus-T form a strong pivoting cores with Azelf. Zarude can bring Azelf in on <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> and Tangrowth, while it can bring Zarude in on foes like Swampert and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>. Thundurus-T can threaten Primarina and Mandibuzz for Azelf, while Azelf can wear down threats like Aegislash for Thundurus-T. Strong Fighting-types like Mienshao and Conkeldurr can remove Dark-types like Umbreon and Zarude. Primarina is a great partner for Azelf, as it threatens Pokemon like Krookodile and Galarian Moltres. In return, Azelf helps remove their common Grass-type checks like Amoonguss and Tangrowth after they are sufficiently chipped. Many Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Zarude can outspeed and threaten Azelf, so a defensive teammate like Amoonguss or Tangrowth can be used to take hits from these foes.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Azelf","pokemonId":"/pokemon/azelf","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Psychic","typeId":"/types/psychic"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":115}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:23.3593285Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."},{"itemName":"Expert Belt","itemId":"/items/expert-belt","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks that are super effective against the target do 1.2x damage."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Psychic","moveId":"/moves/psychic","moveType":{"typeName":"Psychic","typeId":"/types/psychic"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to lower the target's Sp.
