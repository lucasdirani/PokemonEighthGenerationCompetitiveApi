{"strategyName":"Specially Defensive Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/specially-defensive-pivot?pokemon=slowking&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Scald is a reliable STAB move and can severely punish potential checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> with a burn if they attempt to hard switch into it. Future Sight pressures opposing teams and works well with Slowking's teammates to increase their wallbreaking potential and force progress. Slack Off lets Slowking stay healthy to reliably check special wallbreakers without having to rely on Teleport or switches. Teleport is not only a solid pivoting option, but it works well in tandem with Future Sight, as Slowking can bring in a more offensive teammate safely to capitalize on the Future Sight. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Slowking pivot in more freely without getting whittled down by entry hazards and helps to maintain healing from Regenerator. 0 Speed IVs with a Sassy nature allow for it to underspeed or Speed tie with opposing Slowking and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a> with Teleport.</p>\n<p>Slowking fits best on bulky offense and balance, as it is able to check dangerous Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, which are threatening to those team archetypes, while being able to maintain momentum. A lot of offensive Pokemon appreciate the additional pressure of Future Sight as well as Slowking's ability to bring them in safely with Teleport. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> likes having its defensive answers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> pressured by Future Sight, providing it with easier wallbreaking opportunities. Slowking is weak to strong physical attackers such as Rillaboom and Kartana, so switch-ins like Tangrowth and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> make great partners; in return, Slowking checks problematic Pokemon such as Heatran for them. Dark- and Ghost-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a> can threaten Slowking, making Mandibuzz and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> effective partners. In return, Slowking can check Heatran, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, and Nidoking for them. Additionally, Clefable can capitalize on Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Mandibuzz that Slowking pivots against. Electric-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> and Zeraora are threatening, making defensive Landorus-T and Grass-types like Ferrothorn and the aforementioned Tangrowth good partners that can help keep them at bay. When pivoted into battle via Teleport, both Landorus-T and Ferrothorn can force progress with their own Knock Off or set their respective entry hazards. Furthermore, Slowking checks Tapu Lele, Heatran, and Nidoking for them in return.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Slowking","pokemonId":"/pokemon/slowking","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Psychic","typeId":"/types/psychic"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":30}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Oblivious","abilityId":"/abilities/oblivious","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon cannot be infatuated or taunted.
