{"strategyName":"Swords Dance","strategyId":"/strategies/swords-dance?pokemon=aegislash&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Swords Dance lets Aegislash boost up and break down some of its usual checks in <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>. Shadow Claw offers strong neutral coverage against most of the tier. Shadow Sneak prevents faster foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/starmie\" hreflang=\"en\">Starmie</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a> from easily revenge killing Aegislash. Close Combat gives it unresisted coverage and hits Dark-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/crawdaunt\" hreflang=\"en\">Crawdaunt</a> super effectively. Weakness Policy takes advantage of Aegislash's great bulk in Shield forme, which lets it take one super effective hit, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a>'s Crunch or <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a>'s Flamethrower, to boost its Attack even further. Air Balloon is a very good alternative, making Aegislash even harder to revenge kill by hindering Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diggersby\" hreflang=\"en\">Diggersby</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a>.</p>\n<p>This set is an incredible fit on bulky offense and hyper offense teams looking for a strong priority-using sweeper. Aegislash appreciates pivots like Azelf and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>, which can bring it into the field safely; the latter can also give Aegislash even more setup opportunities with Trick + Choice Scarf. Other setup sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> pair really well with Aegislash, as they can overwhelm the opponent and open up holes for it to clean up. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/quagsire\" hreflang=\"en\">Quagsire</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a> are incredibly hard for this set to get past thanks to their high physical bulk, super effective moves, and Unaware in the former's case; all of this makes <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a> an incredible partner, KOing both with Power Whip and Bounce, respectively. Strong special attackers like Primarina, which handle both Quagsire and Buzzwole, are also really good teammates. Entry hazard setters greatly benefit Aegislash; <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ribombee\" hreflang=\"en\">Ribombee</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/shuckle\" hreflang=\"en\">Shuckle</a> provide Sticky Web, letting Aegislash overcome its low Speed, while Krookodile and Rhyperior provide Stealth Rock to soften up foes.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Aegislash","pokemonId":"/pokemon/aegislash","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},{"typeName":"Ghost","typeId":"/types/ghost"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":140},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":140},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":60}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Stance Change","abilityId":"/abilities/stance-change","abilityDetails":"If Aegislash, changes Forme to Blade before attacks and Shield before King's Shield."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:21.4702147Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Weakness Policy","itemId":"/items/weakness-policy","itemDetails":"If holder is hit super effectively, raises Attack, Sp.
