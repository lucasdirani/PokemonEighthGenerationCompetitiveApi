{"strategyName":"Unaware Wall","strategyId":"/strategies/unaware-wall?pokemon=quagsire&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Scald has a good chance to burn threats such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a>. Earthquake hits Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/raikou\" hreflang=\"en\">Raikou</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>. Haze stops setup sweepers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a> in their tracks. Toxic is an option that cripples switch-ins such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and Kommo-o, but it has to give up Scald or the utility of Haze to do so. Heavy-Duty Boots is an option to avoid damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes; however, Quagsire is already resistant to Stealth Rock, and the passive recovery brought by Leftovers is generally much more appreciated. The given EV spread allows Quagsire to take on special attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> more comfortably while maximizing its physical bulk.</p>\n<p>Quagsire fits best on stall teams, stopping setup sweepers with Unaware. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> and Tangrowth are excellent partners for Quagsire, as they check Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>. Additionally, these Pokemon are able to check wallbreakers that Quagsire struggles with, such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a>. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> forms a solid defensive core with Quagsire, being able to check special attackers such as Nihilego and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>, while Quagsire checks physical threats for it in return. Chansey's Heal Bell also allows it to cure status that easily wear down Quagsire. Other clerics such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mew\" hreflang=\"en\">Mew</a> are also good options to pair with Quagsire. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> can help provide Defog support to remove Spikes for Quagsire. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ditto\" hreflang=\"en\">Ditto</a> can provide offensive support and deter setup sweepers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/diggersby\" hreflang=\"en\">Diggersby</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/crawdaunt\" hreflang=\"en\">Crawdaunt</a> that Quagsire can't deal with properly.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Quagsire","pokemonId":"/pokemon/quagsire","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":65},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":35}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Damp","abilityId":"/abilities/damp","abilityDetails":"Prevents Explosion/Mind Blown/Misty Explosion/Self-Destruct/Aftermath while active."},{"abilityName":"Water Absorb","abilityId":"/abilities/water-absorb","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon heals 1/4 of its max HP when hit by Water moves; Water immunity."},{"abilityName":"Unaware","abilityId":"/abilities/unaware","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon ignores other Pokemon's stat stages when taking or doing damage."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:32.6769554Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Unaware","abilityId":"/abilities/unaware","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon ignores other Pokemon's stat stages when taking or doing damage."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Relaxed","natureId":"/natures/relaxed","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":220},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":36},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Scald","moveId":"/moves/scald","moveType":{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"30% chance to burn the target.
