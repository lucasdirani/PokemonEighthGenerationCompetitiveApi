{"strategyName":"Defensive Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/defensive-pivot?pokemon=slowbro&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Future Sight allows Slowbro to pressure the opposing team and help wallbreakers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a> break past their switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-fini\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Fini</a>. Teleport lets Slowbro bring teammates in safely and synergizes well with its bulk and Future Sight. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item as it lets Slowbro avoid entry hazard damage, making it much more difficult to break past and allowing Slowbro to pivot more efficiently. Alternatively, Colbur Berry can be used with Body Press to lure in and remove Weavile. 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature make Slowbro as slow as possible to make it move after opposing Slowbro. Rocky Helmet is another alternate option for Slowbro to punish U-turn users like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and Urshifu-R.</p>\n<p>Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Melmetal, and Weavile appreciate Future Sight's offensive pressure and being brought in safely by Teleport against Pokemon they can force out like Toxapex and Tapu Fini. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a> are great partners, as they check Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and appreciate Slowbro's ability to handle Urshifu-R, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/victini\" hreflang=\"en\">Victini</a>, and Melmetal. Buzzwole in particular can take advantage of Future Sight. Slowbro struggles in handling special attackers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a>, so specially defensive partners like Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Ferrothorn, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a> are useful. Tornadus-T and Galarian Slowking can both form potent Regenerator cores with Slowbro. Ground-types like Landorus-T and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> can take on Electric-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, Tapu Koko, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/regieleki\" hreflang=\"en\">Regieleki</a> for Slowbro and block their Volt Switch attempts. When using Colbur Berry Slowbro, partners like Dragapult, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blacephalon\" hreflang=\"en\">Blacephalon</a>, and Tornadus-T appreciate its ability to remove Weavile for them, with the former two especially benefitting from this, as they can spam their Ghost-type STAB moves more easily. Tornadus-T and Landorus-T can provide entry hazard control for Colbur Berry Slowbro, as it misses out on avoiding entry hazard damage, allowing Slowbro to make the most from Regenerator recovery.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Slowbro","pokemonId":"/pokemon/slowbro","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Psychic","typeId":"/types/psychic"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":30}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Oblivious","abilityId":"/abilities/oblivious","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon cannot be infatuated or taunted.
