{"strategyName":"Physically Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/physically-defensive?pokemon=tangrowth&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Knock Off lets Tangrowth cripple switch-ins such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>. Sludge Bomb helps Tangrowth to not be setup fodder for <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a> and is its best way to hit <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> and opposing Tangrowth. Sludge Bomb's poison chance also helps Tangrowth potentially cripple switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> and opposing Tangrowth. Synthesis provides another method of recovery for Tangrowth, allowing it to check threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> easier without switching out or attacking. Earthquake can be used to weaken and pressure Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> for other teammates, scaring them from switching in directly into Tangrowth. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to punish physical attackers like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a>, Azumarill, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a>.</p>\n<p>Tangrowth fits very well on archetypes like bulky offense, balance, and stall, which appreciate its defensive capabilities and the utility it provides. Because of Tangrowth's miserable Special Defense, partners that can take on special attackers for it such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> and Celesteela are very appreciated. Chansey can take on Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> and Aegislash and set Stealth Rock; its Toxic wearing down common Tangrowth checks such as Rotom-H is also very appreciated. Water-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> and Primarina can all take strong Fire- and Ice-type attacks for Tangrowth and check threats such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chandelure\" hreflang=\"en\">Chandelure</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a>. Primarina also checks <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> for Tangrowth. These Water-types appreciate Tangrowth pivoting directly into Zarude and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a>. Rotom-W and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a> in particular also work as entry hazard removers, and Tangrowth needs this help to avoid getting too weakened. Ground-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a> like having Tangrowth as a teammate, as it can take on Water-types such as Azumarill for them.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Tangrowth","pokemonId":"/pokemon/tangrowth","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":110},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":50}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Chlorophyll","abilityId":"/abilities/chlorophyll","abilityDetails":"If Sunny Day is active, this Pokemon's Speed is doubled."},{"abilityName":"Leaf Guard","abilityId":"/abilities/leaf-guard","abilityDetails":"If Sunny Day is active, this Pokemon cannot be statused and Rest will fail for it."},{"abilityName":"Regenerator","abilityId":"/abilities/regenerator","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon restores 1/3 of its maximum HP, rounded down, when it switches out."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:34.4258834Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Rocky Helmet","itemId":"/items/rocky-helmet","itemDetails":"If holder is hit by a contact move, the attacker loses 1/6 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Regenerator","abilityId":"/abilities/regenerator","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon restores 1/3 of its maximum HP, rounded down, when it switches out."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Relaxed","natureId":"/natures/relaxed","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Giga Drain","moveId":"/moves/giga-drain","moveType":{"typeName":"Grass","typeId":"/types/grass"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":75,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"User recovers 50% of the damage dealt."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Knock Off","moveId":"/moves/knock-off","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":65,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"1.5x damage if foe holds an item.
