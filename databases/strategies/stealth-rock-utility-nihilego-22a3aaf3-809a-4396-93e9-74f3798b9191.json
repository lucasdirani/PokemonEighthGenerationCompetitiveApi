{"strategyName":"Stealth Rock Utility","strategyId":"/strategies/stealth-rock-utility?pokemon=nihilego&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Nihilego's typing allows it to switch into a majority of the tier's Defoggers, including <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a>, and set Stealth Rock. Power Gem threatens many Defoggers and hits neutral targets Sludge Bomb can't, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>. Sludge Bomb threatens Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>. Knock Off cripples checks to Nihilego like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>, and Celesteela. It's also great for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Defoggers. Grass Knot eliminates Pokemon that don't mind Power Gem + Sludge Bomb, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>. However, the utility Knock Off provides is amazing, and it's only worth replacing if Nihilego's team has enough other Knock Off users. Black Sludge mitigates entry hazards and chip damage.</p>\n<p>This set fits on every playstyle except hyper offense. Nihilego's team appreciates its good defensive typing and Knock Off, and its offensive capabilities are valuable for removing threats like Primarina and Salamence. Stall in particular appreciates Nihilego's good matchup against Nasty Plot <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/togekiss\" hreflang=\"en\">Togekiss</a>. Skarmory is an amazing partner for Nihilego, forming an entry hazard stacking core with it and checking major threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>. In return, Nihilego beats threats to Skarmory like Moltres and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a>. Wallbreakers like Thundurus-T, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> love Nihilego setting up Stealth Rock and weakening their checks like Assault Vest Tangrowth, Celesteela, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>. Chansey completely walls this set even after having its Eviolite removed, so these wallbreakers can also take care of it. Pivots like the aformentioned Mienshao and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> can bring in Nihilego to set Stealth Rock and wallbreak. Teammates like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a>, Krookodile, and Tangrowth provide Knock Off support, giving Nihilego the option of running Grass Knot. Aegislash has notable defensive synergy with Nihilego, as it checks Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/lycanroc-dusk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lycanroc-D</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>. Moltres and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> deal with Steel-types that wall Nihilego, like Aegislash and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>.  Nihilego in return can take out physically defensive Tangrowth and Salamence.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Nihilego","pokemonId":"/pokemon/nihilego","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Rock","typeId":"/types/rock"},{"typeName":"Poison","typeId":"/types/poison"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":109},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":53},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":47},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":127},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":131},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":103}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Beast Boost","abilityId":"/abilities/beast-boost","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's highest stat is raised by 1 if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:31.5224882Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Black Sludge","itemId":"/items/black-sludge","itemDetails":"Each turn, if holder is a Poison type, restores 1/16 max HP; loses 1/8 if not."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Beast Boost","abilityId":"/abilities/beast-boost","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's highest stat is raised by 1 if it attacks and KOes another Pokemon."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Stealth Rock","moveId":"/moves/stealth-rock","moveType":{"typeName":"Rock","typeId":"/types/rock"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Hurts foes on switch-in.
