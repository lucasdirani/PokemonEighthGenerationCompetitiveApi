{"strategyName":"Specially Defensive","strategyId":"/strategies/specially-defensive?pokemon=heatran&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>This set acts as a good specially defensive wall, capable of checking threats such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> lacking Focus Blast, Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a>. Magma Storm enables Heatran to trap Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a> and chip down checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>. Taunt allows Heatran to overwhelm <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, Toxapex, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, and Blissey. Toxic wears down Heatran's defensive switch-ins such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, Slowking, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a> and also helps to break through Blissey. Earth Power provides good coverage, allowing Heatran to hit Toxapex and opposing Heatran.</p>\n<p>Grass-types are great partners, as they check bulky Water-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-fini\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Fini</a> and Slowking and benefit from Heatran's ability to pressure Steel-types. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> pairs well with Heatran, as it can pivot on Steel-types to bring in Heatran; furthermore, it weakens Earthquake from Swampert and Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>. Defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> is also a great partner, as it can switch into and pressure common Ground-types such as opposing Landorus-T, Garchomp, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>. Heatran also helps Landorus-T by putting pressure on common Defoggers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>. Since Heatran is able to cripple a lot of its defensive switch-ins, Pokemon that benefit from it like Dragapult, Tornadus-T, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a> are good partners.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Heatran","pokemonId":"/pokemon/heatran","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Fire","typeId":"/types/fire"},{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":91},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":106},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":106},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":77}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Flame Body","abilityId":"/abilities/flame-body","abilityDetails":"30% chance a Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon will be burned."},{"abilityName":"Flash Fire","abilityId":"/abilities/flash-fire","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Fire attacks do 1.5x damage if hit by one Fire move; Fire immunity."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:39.6106543Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Flash Fire","abilityId":"/abilities/flash-fire","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's Fire attacks do 1.5x damage if hit by one Fire move; Fire immunity."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Calm","natureId":"/natures/calm","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":232},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":24}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Magma Storm","moveId":"/moves/magma-storm","moveType":{"typeName":"Fire","typeId":"/types/fire"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":75,"moveDetails":"Traps and damages the target for 4-5 turns."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Earth Power","moveId":"/moves/earth-power","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to lower the target's Sp.
