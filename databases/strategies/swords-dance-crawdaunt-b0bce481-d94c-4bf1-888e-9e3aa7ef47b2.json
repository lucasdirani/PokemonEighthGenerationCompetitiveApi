{"strategyName":"Swords Dance","strategyId":"/strategies/swords-dance?pokemon=crawdaunt&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Sword Dance boosts Crawdaunt's attack to monsterous levels, being able to OHKO walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> at +2. It even has a chance to KO physically defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> after a boost, with a guaranteed KO if Tangrowth has taken any chip. Aqua Jet allows Crawdaunt to hit frailer faster foes and potentially clean a weakened team, OHKOing <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> at +2. Life Orb is used to boost Crawdaunt's power and is preferred despite the recoil.</p>\n<p>This set is intended to be used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker, with Swords Dance allowing Crawdaunt to break through defensive cores with more ease. Crawdaunt should try to set up against slower foes that it forces out such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a>. Pivots such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> can help Crawdaunt switch in. Chansey can also handle threats to Crawdaunt like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> and Thundurus-T while utilizing a slow Teleport to safely bring in Crawdaunt. Crawdaunt struggles against faster threats that can take a boosted Aqua Jet, such as Zarude, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, so checks to these are good partners. Amoonguss, for example, can switch into Keldeo and Zarude, while Fairy-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/togekiss\" hreflang=\"en\">Togekiss</a> can check Hydreigon. Pokemon that can spread paralysis such as Jirachi and the aforementioned Togekiss can help Crawdaunt bypass its low Speed. Sticky Web support from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ribombee\" hreflang=\"en\">Ribombee</a> is also useful for the same reason. This set also appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Crawdaunt","pokemonId":"/pokemon/crawdaunt","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":63},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":120},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":55},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":55}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Hyper Cutter","abilityId":"/abilities/hyper-cutter","abilityDetails":"Prevents other Pokemon from lowering this Pokemon's Attack stat stage."},{"abilityName":"Shell Armor","abilityId":"/abilities/shell-armor","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon cannot be struck by a critical hit."},{"abilityName":"Adaptability","abilityId":"/abilities/adaptability","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's same-type attack bonus (STAB) is 2 instead of 1.5."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:25.8637079Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Adaptability","abilityId":"/abilities/adaptability","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's same-type attack bonus (STAB) is 2 instead of 1.5."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Adamant","natureId":"/natures/adamant","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Swords Dance","moveId":"/moves/swords-dance","moveType":{"typeName":"Normal","typeId":"/types/normal"},"moveCategory":"Non-Damaging","movePower":0,"moveAccuracy":0,"moveDetails":"Raises the user's Attack by 2."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Crabhammer","moveId":"/moves/crabhammer","moveType":{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":100,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"High critical hit ratio."}],"strategyThirdMoves":[{"moveName":"Knock Off","moveId":"/moves/knock-off","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Physical","movePower":65,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"1.5x damage if foe holds an item.
