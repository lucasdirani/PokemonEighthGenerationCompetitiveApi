{"strategyName":"Whirlpool","strategyId":"/strategies/whirlpool?pokemon=tapu-fini&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Whirlpool allows Tapu Fini to trap and remove many Pokemon that cannot significantly damage it, such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> lacking Power Whip. Nature's Madness provides consistent damage on bulkier Pokemon such as the aforementioned ones it can trap, as well as switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowking</a>. Taunt is necessary so that Pokemon like Toxapex, Blissey, and Slowking cannot use their recovery moves or pivot out with Teleport. Knock Off can be used over Moonblast to lure in Galarian Slowking and remove its Assault Vest while wearing Toxapex down more quickly by removing its Black Sludge or Shed Shell, but this makes Tapu Fini unable to reliably check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a>. The EVs allow Tapu Fini to survive three Choice Band-boosted Close Combats from Urshifu-R and two Choice Specs-boosted Shadow Balls from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blacephalon\" hreflang=\"en\">Blacephalon</a> from full health.</p>\n<p>This set can fit on a wide variety of teams, but, as its main purpose is to trap and eliminate certain defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Blissey, and Slowking, it should be used with Pokemon that appreciate them being removed. Weavile is a great option, as Toxapex and Ferrothorn are common checks to it, and it beats Grass-types and Galarian Slowking for Tapu Fini. Urshifu-R can similarly benefit from Toxapex and Slowbro being removed, and it eases prediction against teams with Ferrothorn. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragonite\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragonite</a> can check Grass-types for Tapu Fini, and both can sweep much more easily with Toxapex removed. Ground-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> can switch into Electric-types for Tapu Fini and like its ability to check Weavile and Urshifu-R. If Tapu Fini is using Knock Off, Pokemon that benefit from Galarian Slowking losing its Assault Vest such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> are good teammates.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Tapu Fini","pokemonId":"/pokemon/tapu-fini","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":115},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":130},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":85}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Telepathy","abilityId":"/abilities/telepathy","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon does not take damage from attacks made by its allies."},{"abilityName":"Misty Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/misty-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Misty Terrain."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:46.8912182Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Misty Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/misty-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Misty Terrain."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Calm","natureId":"/natures/calm","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":216},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":40},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Whirlpool","moveId":"/moves/whirlpool","moveType":{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":35,"moveAccuracy":85,"moveDetails":"Traps and damages the target for 4-5 turns."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Moonblast","moveId":"/moves/moonblast","moveType":{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":95,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"30% chance to lower the target's Sp.
