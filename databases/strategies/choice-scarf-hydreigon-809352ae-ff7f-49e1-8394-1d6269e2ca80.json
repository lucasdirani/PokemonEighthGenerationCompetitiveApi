{"strategyName":"Choice Scarf","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-scarf?pokemon=hydreigon&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Hydreigon is a fantastic Choice Scarf user capable of revenge killing threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zygarde-10\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde-10%</a> and Dragon Dance <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>. U-turn is mandatory to escape switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a>. The last moveslot is very flexible. Fire Blast is an option to revenge kill <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a> and more easily break through Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>. Defog creates role compression if required, while Roost can provide some longevity to answer <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a> throughout a match. Roost can be very useful if you let Hydreigon take Knock Off in a matchup where it doesn't require Choice Scarf.</p>\n<p>Choice Scarf Hydreigon fits best on bulky offense teams that require its Speed and offensive presence to keep threats like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azelf\" hreflang=\"en\">Azelf</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus-T</a> in check. Checks to Fairy-types are mandatory. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a> can check <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill</a> and Primarina, while Steel-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> can help check other Fairy-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hatterene\" hreflang=\"en\">Hatterene</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/togekiss\" hreflang=\"en\">Togekiss</a>. Aegislash can also wear down special walls like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> with Toxic and remove Chansey with Close Combat. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a> and Tapu Bulu are powerful wallbreakers that Hydreigon can bring in safely with U-turn, allowing them to remove its checks such as Primarina and Mandibuzz. Azelf can form a pivot core with Hydreigon to get it in safely against Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> and Aegislash. Entry hazard support from Skarmory and Excadrill can help Hydreigon OHKO Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Gyarados. Skarmory can also check Dragon Dance <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a>, a setup sweeper Hydreigon is unable to outspeed and revenge kill. Entry hazard removal from Excadrill and Tentacruel is appreciated due to Hydreigon's frequent pivoting. Tentacruel can also wear down Celesteela with Knock Off and punish its Leech Seed thanks to Liquid Ooze.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Hydreigon","pokemonId":"/pokemon/hydreigon","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":92},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":105},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":125},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":90},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":98}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:40.2724179Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Scarf","itemId":"/items/choice-scarf","itemDetails":"Holder's Speed is 1.5x, but it can only select the first move it executes."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Levitate","abilityId":"/abilities/levitate","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon is immune to Ground; Gravity/Ingrain/Smack Down/Iron Ball nullify it."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Dark Pulse","moveId":"/moves/dark-pulse","moveType":{"typeName":"Dark","typeId":"/types/dark"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"20% chance to make the target flinch."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Draco Meteor","moveId":"/moves/draco-meteor","moveType":{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":130,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Lowers the user's Sp.
