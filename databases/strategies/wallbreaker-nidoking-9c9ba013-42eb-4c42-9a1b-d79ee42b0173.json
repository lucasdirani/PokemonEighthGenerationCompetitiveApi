{"strategyName":"Wallbreaker","strategyId":"/strategies/wallbreaker?pokemon=nidoking&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Nidoking uses Thunderbolt as its most consistent coverage option, super effectively damaging <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>. Thunder is an alternative that applies much more pressure to Slowking and OHKOes <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> as they switch in at the cost of a lower accuracy; however, a Modest nature is necessary if Thunder is used to create a more favorable roll to KO Slowking with a subsequent Sludge Wave. Flamethrower is another coverage option that reliably OHKOes <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a> and can apply pressure to <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> switch-ins. Alternatively, Ice Beam targets Landorus-T and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> but gives Nidoking a more difficult time in pressuring Ferrothorn, which can take advantage of it by using Knock Off, Leech Seed, or Spikes. Substitute is another option that lets Nidoking fully capitalize on a forced switch and safely force damage on a target of its choice without the threat of being knocked out beforehand, which greatly eases the need for prediction, but forces Nidoking to drop an additional coverage option. A Modest nature provides the Nidoking user with a more fruitful damage output and a much more favorable roll to 2HKO Slowking with Thunderbolt. However, Timid allows Nidoking to outspeed <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu</a>, Modest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-lele\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Lele</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>.</p>\n<p>Nidoking's inability to find many natural wallbreaking opportunities makes it a phenomenal partner with offensive pivots such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/dragapult\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragapult</a> that can provide it with opportunities to switch in safely. The former is able to apply great pressure to checks like Corviknight and Slowking while pivoting against bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn; its Electric Terrain, additionally, boosts Nidoking's Thunderbolt, which is prominent against Slowking. The latter pivots against bulky Fairy-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-fini\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Fini</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> while applying pressure to Slowking with its Ghost-type STAB attacks. Additionally, it is capable of utilizing Thunder Wave to slow down Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, turning them into wallbreaking fodder for Nidoking. Nidoking also pairs well with defensive pivots like Corviknight and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a>, which give Nidoking a safe wallbreaking opportunity against Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>. They, additionally, can give Nidoking a good escape option against potential revenge killers like Tapu Lele for Corviknight and Landorus-T in Rotom-W's case. Slowking can also find good pivoting opportunities against Tapu Koko and Tangrowth while giving Nidoking the ability to exploit <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a> for a wallbreaking opportunity. In addition, entry hazards and Knock Off are valuable tools that can greatly aid Nidoking's wallbreaking abilities by forcing checks like Slowking and Landorus-T to fold to its coverage. Ferrothorn, for example, boasts access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off to remove Slowking's Heavy-Duty Boots and more effectively pressure it. Landorus-T is also capable of using Stealth Rock and Knock Off, as well as pivoting against opposing Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini with U-turn and providing Nidoking with a wallbreaking opportunity. Clefable is also a solid Stealth Rock setter that has access to Knock Off.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Nidoking","pokemonId":"/pokemon/nidoking","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Poison","typeId":"/types/poison"},{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":81},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":102},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":77},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":85}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Poison Point","abilityId":"/abilities/poison-point","abilityDetails":"30% chance a Pokemon making contact with this Pokemon will be poisoned."},{"abilityName":"Rivalry","abilityId":"/abilities/rivalry","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's attacks do 1.25x on same gender targets; 0.75x on opposite gender."},{"abilityName":"Sheer Force","abilityId":"/abilities/sheer-force","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's attacks with secondary effects have 1.3x power; nullifies the effects."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:42.9467568Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Life Orb","itemId":"/items/life-orb","itemDetails":"Holder's attacks do 1.3x damage, and it loses 1/10 its max HP after the attack."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Sheer Force","abilityId":"/abilities/sheer-force","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's attacks with secondary effects have 1.3x power; nullifies the effects."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Modest","natureId":"/natures/modest","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"}},{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Sludge Wave","moveId":"/moves/sludge-wave","moveType":{"typeName":"Poison","typeId":"/types/poison"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":95,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to poison adjacent Pokemon."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Earth Power","moveId":"/moves/earth-power","moveType":{"typeName":"Ground","typeId":"/types/ground"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to lower the target's Sp.
