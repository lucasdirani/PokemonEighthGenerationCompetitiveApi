{"strategyName":"SubToxic","strategyId":"/strategies/subtoxic?pokemon=aegislash&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Shadow Ball is a strong STAB move and hits Toxic-immune targets such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/jirachi\" hreflang=\"en\">Jirachi</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>. Toxic cripples common Shadow Ball switch-ins like Bulletproof <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a> and Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> and builds up chip damage for Aegislash's teammates to capitalize on. Substitute allows Aegislash to get even more Toxic damage while also reducing the prediction it needs; it can also stop moves like Amonguss's Spore. King's Shield allows Aegislash to switch into its Shield forme and scout Choiced-locked foes like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> so that it can switch into the right teammate if needed. Heavy investment in HP and Special Defense lets Aegislash switch into Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Slowbro</a> without fearing a 3HKO in Shield forme and cripple or attack them; this investment also stops Amoonguss's Foul Play from breaking its Substitute. 136 Speed EVs are an option to outpace <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/conkeldurr\" hreflang=\"en\">Conkeldurr</a> and everything slower.</p>\n<p>This set is a solid fit on semi-stall and balance teams thanks to its ability to heavily wear down Aegislash's typical checks, open up holes for its teammates, and be a solid defensive presence. Specially defensive foes that don't care about Toxic, like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a>, are incredibly hard for this set to deal with, stopping it from making any progress; that's why powerful wallbreakers such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/buzzwole\" hreflang=\"en\">Buzzwole</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mienshao\" hreflang=\"en\">Mienshao</a> pair really well with it, and Aegislash can soften up some checks to them like Salamence with Toxic damage. Other offensive Pokemon like Jungle Healing <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/obstagoon\" hreflang=\"en\">Obstagoon</a> don't care what Aegislash can do to them, so sturdier walls like Tangrowth and Kommo-o pair really well with this set. Fairy-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/primarina\" hreflang=\"en\">Primarina</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/togekiss\" hreflang=\"en\">Togekiss</a> give it more security against Fighting-types and cover Aegislash's Dark weakness; <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/sylveon\" hreflang=\"en\">Sylveon</a> is a notable partner, giving Aegislash Wish support so that it doesn't rely solely on Leftovers for its recovery. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/umbreon\" hreflang=\"en\">Umbreon</a> is another useful partner, not only providing Wish but also easily spreading Toxic and checking some nuisances for Aegislash like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>. Regenerator and a Poison typing make Amoonguss one of the most obnoxious foes against this set, meaning that offensive checks to it like Moltres and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine</a> are natural partners. Aegislash teams need a secondary check for Tangrowth and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego</a>, as they commonly run Knock Off and can leave Aegislash horribly crippled; Pokemon like Amoonguss can achieve this exact job.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Aegislash","pokemonId":"/pokemon/aegislash","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Steel","typeId":"/types/steel"},{"typeName":"Ghost","typeId":"/types/ghost"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":60},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":140},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":50},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":140},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":60}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Stance Change","abilityId":"/abilities/stance-change","abilityDetails":"If Aegislash, changes Forme to Blade before attacks and Shield before King's Shield."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:22.3395031Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Stance Change","abilityId":"/abilities/stance-change","abilityDetails":"If Aegislash, changes Forme to Blade before attacks and Shield before King's Shield."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Calm","natureId":"/natures/calm","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Shadow Ball","moveId":"/moves/shadow-ball","moveType":{"typeName":"Ghost","typeId":"/types/ghost"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"20% chance to lower the target's Sp.
