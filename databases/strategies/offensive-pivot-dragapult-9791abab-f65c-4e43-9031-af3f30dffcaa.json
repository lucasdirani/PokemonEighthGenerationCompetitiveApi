{"strategyName":"Offensive Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/offensive-pivot?pokemon=dragapult&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Dragapult's access to status, U-turn, and STAB Hex makes it a potent disruptor and pivot capable of sweeping past chipped down teams. Additionally, its blistering Speed tier alongside U-turn lets it operate as a superb check to fast Pokemon on offensively inclined teams, being able to take advantage of forced switches with ease to generate momentum or force progress with status. Dragapult's choice of status condition is highly dependent on the needs of its team, as well as what it wishes to target. Thunder Wave typically is the preferred option, as it is capable of punishing and crippling most of Dragapult's checks, including <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a> and situationally <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> while slowing down fast offensive Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> for its teammates. Will-O-Wisp, however, can be a great option that takes advantage of and ruins the value of physical attackers while negating Leftovers recovery of <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gastrodon\" hreflang=\"en\">Gastrodon</a> and forcing passive damage on <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>. Dragapult's vulnerability to entry hazards as an offensive pivot makes it a great user of Heavy-Duty Boots, enabling it to more reliably generate momentum in the long term. Lastly, Infiltrator lets Dragapult wholly disregard dual screens and Substitute and more freely force damage and inflict status on hyper offense builds. Access to Infiltrator also allows Dragapult to disregard Safeguard <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona</a> and reliably paralyze it.</p>\n<p>Dragapult's ability to check faster Pokemon and facilitate offensive teammates with its access to status, fast U-turn, and ability to invite in its exploitable checks makes it a phenomenal pick on balance teams. Likewise, it also appreciates offensive teammates that are able to help it handle its checks due to its relative lack of immediate power. For example, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a> is a superb teammate that highly appreciates Dragapult's ability to slow down or weaken fast, offensive threats such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> and Tornadus-T while also being able to take heavy advantage of Dragapult checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a> for wallbreaking opportunities. Additionally, Urshifu-R is capable of pivoting against Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> to give Dragapult more opportunities to spread status. Kartana, similarly, heavily appreciates Dragapult's ability to cripple potential checks while providing it with safe switch in against Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Blissey. Thunder Wave also allows Kartana to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile</a>, improving its cleaning potential in the long run. Access to Knock Off can also allow Kartana to enforce progress for Dragapult and leave its checks more vulnerable to entry hazards and chip damage. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a> is a great offensive partner that likes having checks in <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and mixed Clefable dispatched by Thunder Wave, exploits <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a>, and takes great advantage of Dragapult's pivoting abilities while helping it deal with Clefable, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon more effectively. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a> is also a great partner that can utilize both Knock Off and Stealth Rock to enforce progress for Dragapult while providing a solid switch-in against <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>, which may attempt to revenge kill it otherwise if it has sustained any chip damage. Lastly, Dragapult's ability to compress roles with its Speed tier to offensive check fast Pokemon, status, and cleaning make it a good fit on more defensively inclined teams alongside the aforementioned Landorus-T and allies such as Clefable and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a> that are similarly able to spread item removal and set entry hazards.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Dragapult","pokemonId":"/pokemon/dragapult","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},{"typeName":"Ghost","typeId":"/types/ghost"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":88},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":120},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":142}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Clear Body","abilityId":"/abilities/clear-body","abilityDetails":"Prevents other Pokemon from lowering this Pokemon's stat stages."},{"abilityName":"Infiltrator","abilityId":"/abilities/infiltrator","abilityDetails":"Moves ignore substitutes and foe's Reflect/Light Screen/Safeguard/Mist/Aurora Veil."},{"abilityName":"Cursed Body","abilityId":"/abilities/cursed-body","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon is hit by an attack, there is a 30% chance that move gets disabled."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:37.3226282Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Infiltrator","abilityId":"/abilities/infiltrator","abilityDetails":"Moves ignore substitutes and foe's Reflect/Light Screen/Safeguard/Mist/Aurora Veil."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Hex","moveId":"/moves/hex","moveType":{"typeName":"Ghost","typeId":"/types/ghost"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":65,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"Power doubles if the target has a status ailment."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Draco Meteor","moveId":"/moves/draco-meteor","moveType":{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":130,"moveAccuracy":90,"moveDetails":"Lowers the user's Sp.
