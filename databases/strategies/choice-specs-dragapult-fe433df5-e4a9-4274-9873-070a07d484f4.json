{"strategyName":"Choice Specs","strategyId":"/strategies/choice-specs?pokemon=dragapult&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>When equipped with a Choice Specs, Dragapult becomes a menacing wallbreaker that can easily overwhelm a majority of the metagame with its STAB Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball. In particular, Shadow Ball is an incredibly spammable, powerful option that is incredibly hard to switch into without a dedicated answer that is able to handle Dragapult's other options in the long run, like specially defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex</a>, or <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a>. U-turn allows Dragapult to exploit and safely chip away at its small pool of checks to generate momentum, allowing offensive teammates to either enforce progress or safely wallbreak. Dragapult's last coverage move largely depends on the offensive core around it - Flamethrower is a highly effective coverage option that lets it apply more immediate pressure against targets like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/scizor\" hreflang=\"en\">Scizor</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>. Hydro Pump allows Dragapult to further pressure <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> and beat <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a> and specially defensive <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, or Thunderbolt or Thunder to instead pressure would-be checks such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-fini\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Fini</a>, and Toxapex. Thunder, notably, is capable of more reliably finishing off specially defensive Toxapex at the cost of accuracy and PP. Although a more niche option, Hex lets Dragapult overwhelm <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/gastrodon\" hreflang=\"en\">Gastrodon</a>, Hippowdon, and Clefable when they've been statused, but it leaves Dragapult extremely reliant on teammates that can spread status. Dragapult's access to Infiltrator alongside its fantastic Speed tier makes it a great answer to offense teams, wholly disregarding dual screens and Substitute from Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a> and Landorus-T, making it the ideal choice over the more situational Clear Body.</p>\n<p>Dragapult's ability to pivot around Clefable, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar</a>, and Blissey lets it pair incredibly well with offensive Pokemon that are capable of helping it break past them and remove shared checks. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/urshifu-rapid-strike\" hreflang=\"en\">Urshifu-R</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal\" hreflang=\"en\">Melmetal</a> are incredible examples of great U-turn recipients. The former can use its powerful STAB combination to beat Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Blissey while helping it deal with Tapu Fini and Toxapex. Similarly, Melmetal also takes advantage of U-turn to come in against Clefable and Blissey, and its access to Toxic and Thunder Wave further reinforces Dragapult's wallbreaking potential with Hex. In return, Dragapult is capable of using its Ghost-type STAB and powerful Draco Meteor to hit or pivot against their checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a>, and Corviknight. Additionally, Kyurem and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a> can be fantastic in helping Dragapult overwhelm shared Fairy- and Steel-type checks in the form of Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal. They also appreciate Dragapult's ability to pivot against Pokemon like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon to find critical wallbreaking opportunities. Heatran is another U-turn recipient that is capable of trapping Toxapex, Clefable, and Blissey with Magma Storm or setting Stealth Rock. Dragapult also greatly appreciates Knock Off support in order to strip checks like Clefable and Tapu Fini of Leftovers recovery while leaving others like Mandibuzz and Blissey more vulnerable to entry hazards. Ferrothorn is a solid option that can target foes like Heatran with Knock Off to create progress for Dragapult and is also capable of setting entry hazards. Additionally, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a> is an incredible, more offensively inclined Knock Off user that benefits from Dragapult's U-turn, easily ripping past Dragapult's checks like Gastrodon, Clefable, and Hippowdon with its high Attack, STAB attacks, and coverage. Landorus-T's access to Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Knock Off makes it capable of targeting and pressuring shared checks in the form of Mandibuzz and Tapu Fini while hitting Toxapex super effectively and providing Dragapult with both a <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a> switch-in and pivoting support. Landorus-T also appreciates Dragapult's ability to provide it with a safe entry against Pokemon like Tyranitar and Blissey, which it can easily exploit to enforce progress with its utility.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Dragapult","pokemonId":"/pokemon/dragapult","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Dragon","typeId":"/types/dragon"},{"typeName":"Ghost","typeId":"/types/ghost"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":88},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":120},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":100},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":142}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Clear Body","abilityId":"/abilities/clear-body","abilityDetails":"Prevents other Pokemon from lowering this Pokemon's stat stages."},{"abilityName":"Infiltrator","abilityId":"/abilities/infiltrator","abilityDetails":"Moves ignore substitutes and foe's Reflect/Light Screen/Safeguard/Mist/Aurora Veil."},{"abilityName":"Cursed Body","abilityId":"/abilities/cursed-body","abilityDetails":"If this Pokemon is hit by an attack, there is a 30% chance that move gets disabled."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:37.3204277Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Choice Specs","itemId":"/items/choice-specs","itemDetails":"Holder's Sp.
