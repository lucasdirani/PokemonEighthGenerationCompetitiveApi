{"strategyName":"RestTalk","strategyId":"/strategies/resttalk?pokemon=primarina&tier=uu","strategyDetails":"<p>Thanks to its bulk, Primarina continuously checks threats such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/salamence\" hreflang=\"en\">Salamence</a> by healing itself with Rest while taking advantage of its excellent STAB combination with Sleep Talk. Rest allows it to not be ruined by status such as Toxic from <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash\" hreflang=\"en\">Aegislash</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/krookodile\" hreflang=\"en\">Krookodile</a>. Moonblast is great neutral coverage while also proving super effective damage on <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kommo-o\" hreflang=\"en\">Kommo-o</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres-galar\" hreflang=\"en\">Galarian Moltres</a>. Scald allows Primarina to get a burn on switch-ins like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/amoonguss\" hreflang=\"en\">Amoonguss</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tentacruel\" hreflang=\"en\">Tentacruel</a>, negating the recovery from their items. 124 Special Defense EVs and Leftovers allow Primarina to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chandelure\" hreflang=\"en\">Chandelure</a>'s Shadow Ball and 3HKO from Salamence's Hurricane from full HP without Stealth Rock, with the rest put into Defense to take on Dragon Dance Salamence and Keldeo's Secret Sword better. Leftovers is great, as it synergizes well with Rest + Sleep Talk, but Heavy-Duty Boots is an option to negate damage from entry hazards if the team has unreliable or no hazard removal.</p>\n<p>RestTalk Primarina is mainly used on bulky teams that appreciate a status sponge and value the defensive qualities its typing provides. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/necrozma\" hreflang=\"en\">Necrozma</a> is an excellent partner, as it can threaten Amoonguss and Tentacruel, that would otherwise counter Primarina. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zarude\" hreflang=\"en\">Zarude</a> checks <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey</a> while appreciating Primarina checking Keldeo and Kommo-o. Fire-types such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-heat\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-H</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/moltres\" hreflang=\"en\">Moltres</a> can help check Grass-types such as Zarude and Assault Vest <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a>, and provide momentum with Volt Switch and U-turn. Hazard control is important for Primarina to not be chipped down easily and forced to use Rest if it is running Leftovers. Salamence removes entry hazards with Defog and checks Zarude well. Kommo-o, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rhyperior\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhyperior</a>, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can all form solid defensive cores with Primarina, as they are able to check Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/volcanion\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcanion</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/thundurus\" hreflang=\"en\">Thundurus</a>, and Rotom-W nicely, while Primarina checks Salamence, Keldeo, and Moltres in return.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Primarina","pokemonId":"/pokemon/primarina","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Water","typeId":"/types/water"},{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":80},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":74},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":74},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":126},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":116},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":60}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Torrent","abilityId":"/abilities/torrent","abilityDetails":"At 1/3 or less of its max HP, this Pokemon's attacking stat is 1.5x with Water attacks."},{"abilityName":"Liquid Voice","abilityId":"/abilities/liquid-voice","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon's sound-based moves become Water type."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"UU","tierId":"/tiers/uu"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:32.2968241Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"UnderUsed","tierId":"/tiers/uu"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Leftovers","itemId":"/items/leftovers","itemDetails":"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP."},{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Torrent","abilityId":"/abilities/torrent","abilityDetails":"At 1/3 or less of its max HP, this Pokemon's attacking stat is 1.5x with Water attacks."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Calm","natureId":"/natures/calm","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":132},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":124},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":0}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Moonblast","moveId":"/moves/moonblast","moveType":{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":95,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"30% chance to lower the target's Sp.
