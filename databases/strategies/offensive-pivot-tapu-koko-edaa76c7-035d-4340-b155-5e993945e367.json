{"strategyName":"Offensive Pivot","strategyId":"/strategies/offensive-pivot?pokemon=tapu-koko&tier=ou","strategyDetails":"<p>Dazzling Gleam is a good secondary STAB move that's safe to use for reliable damage. Additionally, it's super effective against Dragon-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/latios\" hreflang=\"en\">Latios</a> that resist Thunderbolt. It's also the best option for damaging Electric-immune Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T</a>, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora</a>. U-turn allows Tapu Koko to reliably pivot against Ground-types like Landorus-T and keep up momentum against switch-ins such as <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn</a>. Roost allows Tapu Koko to stay healthy throughout a match in order to check Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> more consistently. Toxic can be used instead of Dazzling Gleam to cripple Pokemon like Landorus-T, <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/tangrowth\" hreflang=\"en\">Tangrowth</a> that can be problematic for Tapu Koko and is especially useful alongside teammates such as Garchomp and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/kartana\" hreflang=\"en\">Kartana</a>.</p>\n<p>Tapu Koko is often used on offensively oriented teams. Its ability to keep up momentum is appreciated by a multitude of strong wallbreakers that struggle to find effective opportunities to switch in such as Kartana, Choice Specs Kyurem, and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking</a>, which can be safely brought in via U-turn against the bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn that switch into Tapu Koko. <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran</a> also takes advantage of Grass-types that Tapu Koko forces in, can set Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team, and use Toxic to cripple Pokemon like Hippowdon and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a> that wall Tapu Koko. Additionally, it can trap and remove <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey\" hreflang=\"en\">Blissey</a> with the combination of Magma Storm and Taunt. Offensive Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/rillaboom\" hreflang=\"en\">Rillaboom</a> and Kartana appreciate that Tapu Koko can switch in and take advantage of their defensive checks like <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/corviknight\" hreflang=\"en\">Corviknight</a> and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz</a> while also being a good answer to Tornadus-T. Furthermore, they can work together to overwhelm other checks like defensive Tangrowth. Landorus-T can set Stealth Rock and use U-turn to bring Tapu Koko in against Pokemon like Corviknight and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a> while also being a good check to some opposing Ground-types. Slowbro and <a href=\"/dex/ss/pokemon/slowking\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowking</a> can both use Future Sight and Teleport to help Tapu Koko put pressure on the opposing team, especially against Ground-types that might try to switch into it. They also appreciate that Tapu Koko can handle Zapdos and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T.</p>\n","strategyCreator":{"userName":"Smogon University","userId":"/users/smogon-university"},"strategyPokemon":{"pokemonName":"Tapu Koko","pokemonId":"/pokemon/tapu-koko","pokemonTypes":[{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"}],"pokemonBaseStats":[{"baseStat":{"statName":"HP"},"baseStatNumber":70},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"baseStatNumber":115},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"baseStatNumber":85},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"baseStatNumber":95},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"baseStatNumber":75},{"baseStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"baseStatNumber":130}],"pokemonAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Telepathy","abilityId":"/abilities/telepathy","abilityDetails":"This Pokemon does not take damage from attacks made by its allies."},{"abilityName":"Electric Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/electric-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Electric Terrain."}],"pokemonTiers":[{"tierName":"OU","tierId":"/tiers/ou"}]},"strategyCreationDate":"2022-02-22T11:03:47.4720028Z","strategyTier":{"tierName":"OverUsed","tierId":"/tiers/ou"},"strategyItems":[{"itemName":"Heavy-Duty Boots","itemId":"/items/heavy-duty-boots","itemDetails":"When switching in, the holder is unaffected by hazards on its side of the field."}],"strategyAbilities":[{"abilityName":"Electric Surge","abilityId":"/abilities/electric-surge","abilityDetails":"On switch-in, this Pokemon summons Electric Terrain."}],"strategyNatures":[{"natureName":"Timid","natureId":"/natures/timid","natureDecreasedStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"natureIncreasedStat":{"statName":"Speed"}}],"strategyEffortValues":[[{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"effortValueNumber":0},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"effortValueNumber":252},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"effortValueNumber":4},{"effortValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"effortValueNumber":252}]],"strategyIndividualValues":[[{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"HP"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Attack"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Special Defense"},"individualValueNumber":31},{"individualValueStat":{"statName":"Speed"},"individualValueNumber":31}]],"strategyPartners":[],"strategyCounters":[],"strategyCheckers":[],"strategyMoves":{"strategyFirstMoves":[{"moveName":"Thunderbolt","moveId":"/moves/thunderbolt","moveType":{"typeName":"Electric","typeId":"/types/electric"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":90,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"10% chance to paralyze the target."}],"strategySecondMoves":[{"moveName":"Dazzling Gleam","moveId":"/moves/dazzling-gleam","moveType":{"typeName":"Fairy","typeId":"/types/fairy"},"moveCategory":"Special","movePower":80,"moveAccuracy":100,"moveDetails":"No additional effect.
